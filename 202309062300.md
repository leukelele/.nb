The Empirical Risk function may be adapted for nonlinear data sets.
## question
- [x] how does an empirical risk function work in the context of nonlinear functions?
## evidence
- similar to empirical loss function [^1]
- What is the equation for nonlinear least squares regression risk function? ::: ![[2309062300e]]
- the goal of equation is to minimize the average sum-squared error between the prediction and the machineâ€™s response
