The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a decentralized naming system for resources connected to the internet. Its primary function is to translate human-readable addresses into computer-readable ones. 

Its naming format follows a hierarchical format:
- *root name server*. the highest level in the hierarchy; it is contacted when a client does not know a requested name mapping, the server directs the client to the appropriate TLD server
- *top-level domain (TLD) server*. responsible for .org, .com, .edu, etc. in addition to all country domains
- *authoritative server*. the organizationsâ€™ DNS server(s); this is where the actual DNS records are held
- *caching/recursive servers*. deals in the majority of traffic inquiries; the server checks with it already knows the IP address, and queries appropriately to its designation
