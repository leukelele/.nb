The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a decentralized naming system for resources connected to the internet. Its primary function is to translate human-readable addresses into computer-readable ones. 

Its naming format follows a hierarchical format:
- *root name server*. the highest level in the hierarchy; it is contacted when a client does not know a requested name mapping, the server directs the client to the appropriate TLD server
- *top-level domain (TLD) server*. response for .org, .com, .edu, etc. in addition to all 
- authoritative server
- caching/recursive servers
