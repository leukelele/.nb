As stated by the `qtile` maintainer: [^1]
> DPI: this is controlled via the output manager protocol, and so you need a utility to use as a client, for example `kanshi`, `wlr-randr` or `wdisplays` (similar to`autorandr`, `xrandr` and `arandr` respectively).

My laptop monitor does not follow the typical resolution of `1920x1080` but rather has a resolution of `2880x1800`.  Using `wlr-randr` [^2], the command used for DPI-scaling (fractional scaling) is:
```
wlr-randr --output eDP-1 --scale 1.70
```
