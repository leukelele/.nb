There are two considerations when setting the TCP timeout value:
- *too short*. premature timeout => unnecessary retransmissions [^2]
	- the timeout must be longer than the RTT [^1] so that there is time for packets to be transmitted; additionally, RTT often varies
- *too long*. slow to react to segment loss

The solution to account for the considerations are as follows: $$\text{New-EstimatedRTT} = (1 - \alpha)EstimatedRTT + \alpha(SampleRTT)$$ The equation recursively reapplies on itself using the “New-EstimatedRTT” for the “EstimatedRTT” in its next iteration.
