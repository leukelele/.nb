## conclusion
The **empirical risk function** identifies the average of all values produced by the cost function given the training vectors; the average is the penalty the machine learning model receives. The risk function is a broader concept that encompasses the cost function. <!--SR:!2023-09-18,4,270-->

The goal of a machine learning algorithm is to minimize the risk function $\ell(\theta)$ defined as the expected value of $\ell_n(\theta)$.

## question
- [x] what is a risk function?
- [x] how is a risk function different to a loss function [^1]?

## evidence
- a cost/loss function quantifies the accuracy of a machine learning model [^2] 
- What is the Empirical Risk function? ::: The risk function is represented as follows ![[2309060055e]]
- the risk function is semantically interpreted as the penalty the ml model receives given the environment value $x_1$ relative to the machine’s knowledge $\theta$
