This node is more of a refresher for myself as it has been some time since I last worked with sockets. The code that I will be using as reference will be provided by [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/). 

So to begin, the libraries that will be necessary are
```c
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```
The most notable libraries in this case are: `<netinet/in.h>` and `<sys/socket.h>`. From the manual, `<netinet/in.h>` seems to provide constants and structures for IP addresses, while `<sys/socket.h>' provides the ability for creating endpoints that will be used for network communication.


```
#define PORT 8080
```
This defines the port that the server will be listening to, which is port 8080.


```
int main(int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    int server_fd, new_socket;
    ssize_t valread;
    struct sockaddr_in address;
    int opt = 1;
    socklen_t addrlen = sizeof(address);
    char buffer[1024] = { 0 };
    char* hello = "Hello from server";
    ...
```
