This node is more of a refresher for myself as it has been some time since I last worked with sockets. The code that I will be using as reference will be the code provided by [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/). So to begin, the libraries that will be necessary are
```c
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```
The most notable libraries in this case are: `<netinet/in.h>` and `<sys/socket.h>`. From the manual, `<netinet/in.h>` seems to provide constants and structures for IP addresses; while `<sys/socket.h>' provides the ability for creating endpoints for network communication.
