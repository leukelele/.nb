Some reasons for why social engineering attacks are effective are:
- **authority**. impersonating individuals with power
- **intimidation**. bully tactics
- **consensus**. the beliefs that everyone does something
- **scarcity**. implicating that goods/services are limited in quantity
- **familiarity**. trust is often placed in wherever there is a connection
- **trust**. an emotional relationship built over time
- **urgency**. the illusion of importance that requires immediate action
