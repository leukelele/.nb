In continuation of my home server project [^1], now that I have a minimal server, I would like to also to be able to remotely access the server - that is, I want to set up an `ssh` server. This was where I found myself learning the most from this project. Because I opted for a minimal installation, the tools that I am used to weren't there. First and foremost, I needed to launch root:
```
$ su -
password: []

```
[^2] [^3]

And installed `sudo` along with `net-tools` (tools for checking network status), `ufw` (firewall), and `openssh-server` (the ssh-server).
```
$ apt update
...
$ apt install sudo net-tools ufw openssh-server
...

```

At this point I wanted to add a user to be in sudoers group:
```
useradd -aG sudo "theUser"
```

Now to check that there is a `sshd service` installed on the host:
```
$ sudo systemctl status sshd
```

I checked for whether the service was `active` and `enabled`. Continually, It would also be prudent to be sure that `ssh` is not configured to allow `ssh` access root; additionally, I used this time to make sure that `ssh` is access through port 22:
```
$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

While in the file, I needed to be sure that `port 22` was uncommentted and that `PermitRootLogin` was set to `no`:
```
...
port 22
...
PermitRootLogin no
...
```

Afterwards, I exited root and made use of `sudo` instead. I allowed connection to the server through `ssh`:
```
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
Rules updated
Rules updated (v6)
```

After checking that everything seemed to be correct, I restarted the `sshd` service to ensure that my changes were applied:
```
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
$ sudo systemctl status sshd
```

Now the tast was to find the IP address of the server to connect to remotely:
```
$ sudo ifconfig
...
```

After finding the IP address `ifconfig`'s output, I used the following command to connect to the server:
```
$ ssh -p <port> <username>@<ip_address>
```

It then asked for my password, which I inputted, and SUCCESS. It works beautifully.


[^1]: The project being reference may be found here [[2407070014]], it describes my experience with the installation process.
[^2]: I would like to come back here another time; aside from `sudo`, there is also `doas`. Additionally, why not just use `su`?
[^3]: The reason for the `-` after `su` is to invoke a login shell and may be preferable for certain tools because otherwise there may be instances where the shell doesn't recognize a command even if you know it was installed.
