HDL introduces concurrent signal assignment. In an assignment statement any changes to the input signals (operands) will reflect in the output signal accordingly.

Additionally an output cannot be used as an input; this may be resolved by assigning a variable as a “buffer port type”.

Signals will retain their current value unless an event occurs that is part of the sensitivity list.
```vhdl
process (sensitivity list) begin
	statement (event);
end process;
```
