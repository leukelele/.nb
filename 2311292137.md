Retransmissions, in a TCP connection [^1], are triggered by:
- *premature timeout*. [^2] the timeout is too short for the sender to receive the ACK returned from the receiver ![[2311300113e|500]]
- *lost ACK scenario*. [^3] the ACK is lost in transit ![[2311302054e|500]] 
- *cumulative ACK*. [^3] the sender receives an ACK that recognizes not only the most recently received data but also previous segments that have been successfully received ![[2311302110e|500]]

[^1]: [[2311062159]] TCP is a connection-oriented protocol designed for reliability on top of an overall unreliable network infrastructure.
[^2]: [[2311292118]] a timeout must be carefully determined; regardless, there may be incidents along transit that cause delay.
[^3]: [[2311282347]] the ACK is a value that works alongside the “acknowledgement number”; the former indicates if the acknowledgement number is valid.
