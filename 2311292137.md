Retransmissions, in a TCP connection [^1], are triggered by:
- *premature timeout*. the timeout is too short for the sender to receive the ACK returned from the receiver ![[2311300113e]] 
- *lost ACK scenario*. the ACK is lost in transit
- *cumulative ACK*. the sender receives an ACK that recognizes not only the most recently received data but also previous segments that have been successfully received

- timeouts [^2]
- duplicate acks [^3]



[^2]: [[2311292118]] a timeout must be carefully determined; regardless, there may be incidents along transit that cause delay.
[^3]: [[2311282347]] the ACK is a value that works alongside the “acknowledgement number”; the former indicates if the acknowledgement number is valid.
