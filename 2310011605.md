There are four notable factors that influence packet delay, of which may be represented by the following equation: $$d_\text{nodal} = d_\text{proc} + d_\text{queue} + d_\text{tran} + d_\text{prop}$$
- $d_\text{nodal}$ - the total packet delay 
- $d_\text{proc}$ - *nodal processing*. the time it takes for the node to examine the packetâ€™s header and direct the packet; typically less than a millisecond
- $d_\text{queue}$ - *queuing delay*. the time the packet waits at an output link for transmission
- $d_\text{tran}$ - *transmission delay*. the packet can only be transmitted once the entire packet has arrived to the router 
- $d_\text{prop}$ - *propagation delay*. the time
