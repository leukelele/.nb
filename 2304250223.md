Assume there exists some collection described as in [[2304250226]]. In the following model, $$y_{i} = g(x_{i})$$the collection would be used to infer the function $g$. The identified $g$ may then be used to predict the values of $y$, given a new value $x$ - not previously present in the provided collection. Finding the function $g$ is known as **regression**; often, the decision for $g$ may be arbitrary. <!--SR:!2023-11-08,71,270-->
