Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the webâ€™s [^1] application layer protocol; it follows a client-server model [^2] and is based on TCP; it uses port 80. Additionally, HTTP is *stateless* - that is, the server maintains no information on past clients.

The general HTTP procedures are as follows: ![[2310040326e]] [^3]
Additionally, the RTT describes the time that it takes for a small packet to travel from the client, to the server, then back to the client. Typically, the HTTP response time is represented by $$\text{HTTP response time}= 2\text{ RTT} + \text{file transmission time}$$

[^1]: [[2310040219]] the web uses HTTP for communication between the client and server.
