Availability [^1] ensures that data and services are accessible when needed and can be increased through the implementation of redundancy and fault tolerance, in addition to ensuring that the system is up-to-date with current patches. In short, fault tolerance refers to a system's ability to continue operating despite experiencing a fault.

Additionally, scalability and elasticity are important factors in availability:
- **horizontal scalability**. refers to the increase capacity to meed new demand (e.g. adding more servers to meet increasing demand)
- **vertical scalability**. refers to the addition of resources (e.g. adding more RAM).
- **elasticity**. automates the scalability according to the current demands of the system

Although likely to raise the **total cost of ownership (TCO)**, a common goal is to reduce the number of **single points of failure (SPOF)** (e.g. there is a server with a single drive, the drive itself is a SPOF because if it fails, then the whole server will be taken down). However, current trends lean towards increasing the systemâ€™s resilience - that is, its ability to {{recover from a fault}}.
