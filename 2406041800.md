Availability ensures that data and services are accessible when needed and can be increased through the implementation of redundancy and fault tolerance - in addition to ensuring that the system is up-to-date with current patches.

Increasing redundancy makes the system more fault-tolerant, allowing services to continue without immediate issues when specific mechanisms fail:
- disk redundancy
- server redundancy
- network redundancy
- power redundancy

Additionally, a scalability and elasticity are important factors in availability:
- ***horizontal scalability***. refers to the increase capacity to meed new demand (e.g. adding more servers to meet increasing demand)
- ***vertical scalability***. refers to the addition of resources such as RAM.
- ***elasticity***. automates the scalability according to the current demands of the system

Although likely to raise the **total cost of ownership (TCO)**, a common goal is to reduce the number of **single points of failure (SPOF)**. However, current trends lean towards increasing the system’s resilience—that is, its ability to recover from a fault.
