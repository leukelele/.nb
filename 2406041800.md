Availability [^1] ensures that data and services are accessible when needed and can be increased through the implementation of redundancy [^2] and fault tolerance, in addition to ensuring that the system is up-to-date with current patches. In short, fault tolerance refers a system's ability to continue operating despite experiencing a fault. [^3]

Although likely to raise the **total cost of ownership (TCO)**, a common goal is to reduce the number of **single points of failure (SPOF)** (e.g. there is a server with a single drive, the drive itself is a SPOF because if it fails, then the whole server will be taken down). However, current trends lean towards increasing the systemâ€™s resilience - that is, its ability to recover from a fault.

[^1]: [[2406041346]] further expands on how to increase availability, which is a component of the CIA security triad.
[^2]: There are many ways to implement/increase redudancy, as indicated in [[2406302106]].
[^3]: There are also factors like scalability and elasticity, mentioned in [[2406302118]], that determine the system's capabilities in current performance before falling back to other protocols.
