Availability [^1] ensures that data and services are accessible when needed and can be increased through the implementation of redundancy and fault tolerance, in addition to ensuring that the system is up-to-date with current patches. In short, fault tolerance refers to a system's ability to continue operating despite experiencing a fault.

Increasing redundancy makes the system more fault-tolerant, enabling services to continue without immediate issues when specific mechanisms fail. This can be achieved through:
- ***Disk redundancy***. fault-tolerant disks (e.g., RAID [^2]) allow a system to continue functioning even if a disk were to fail.
- ***Server redundancy***. failover clusters enable the system to switch from a failed server to a redundant server within the same cluster.
- ***Network redundancy***. load balancing often utilizes multiple servers and network interface cards (NICs), providing redundancy support and increased bandwidth by employing two or more NICs in a single server.
- ***Power redundancy***. uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and power generators supply power to key systems in case of commercial power failure.

Additionally, scalability and elasticity are important factors in availability:
- ***horizontal scalability***. refers to the increase capacity to meed new demand (e.g. adding more servers to meet increasing demand)
- ***vertical scalability***. refers to the addition of resources (e.g. adding more RAM).
- ***elasticity***. automates the scalability according to the current demands of the system

Although likely to raise the **total cost of ownership (TCO)**, a common goal is to reduce the number of **single points of failure (SPOF)** (e.g. there is a server with a single drive, the drive itself is a SPOF because if it fails, then the whole server will be taken down). However, current trends lean towards increasing the system’s resilience - that is, its ability to {{recover from a fault}}.

[^2]: What exactly is RAID? I’m guessing it has nothing to do with the roach spray.
