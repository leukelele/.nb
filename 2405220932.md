There aren’t a lot of immediately apparent forums and/or documentation indicating how I would go about add transparency to Wayland Qtile’s bar; however, I do think there is a native feature that would allow this: 
- [Wayland Qtile example config](https://codeberg.org/JustineSmithies/qtile-wayland-dotfiles/src/branch/master)
- [discussion among Qtile developers](https://github.com/qtile/qtile/discussions/2508)
