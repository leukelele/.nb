The game of Twenty requires a minimum of 2 players and may have up to 4 players. The game ends when a playerâ€™s count has reached 20 or a player has played all their cards. A count begins at 1 and increases, respective to the player, by one when a player *makes the count*.
1. Each player begins with 7 cards face down and may view their cards once the game begins. The values of the cards are as follows:
	- *Ace*. counts as 1
	- *2 - 9*. counts towards their face values
	- *10, Jack, and Queen*. individually count as 10, but should there be a pair of cards with the same value (e.g. a pair of 10s, a pair of Jacks, etc.) then the pair may count as 10 rather than 20. The player may choose.
	- *King*. may count as any amount between 1 - 20.
2. Each turn has two options:
	- Draw one card,
	- or *makes the count* by playing a card equal to their increased count or playing a set of cards that equal to their increased count.
3. Once an objective has been met, add the value of the remaining cards left in hand, respectively, This totals as the amount of points penalized to the respective player.
