What is the first thing that should be done when starting a new section of a book? Why? ::: First glance through the contents of the section for headers, bold text, diagrams, and other notable visual objects. In doing so, neural hooks are formed so that, as the content of the section is being read, the concepts are more easily understood. <!--SR:!2024-01-18,442,330-->

What are two neural networks that have a major influence in learning? Explain each mode. ::: The highly attentive state (focused mode) and resting state network (diffuse mode).

The high attentive state allows for the gathering of preliminary information, while the resting state network connects the newly gather material with existing neural clusters.<!--SR:!2025-10-27,839,312-->
