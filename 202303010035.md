For convenience, a GNFA must have a special form that meets the following conditions.
- The start state has transition arrows going to every other state but an indegree of 0.
- There exists a single accept state and has arrows coming in from every other state, but an outdegree of 0.
- Except for the start and accept states, one arrow goes from every state to every other state and also from each state to itself.

A generalized nondeterministic finite automaton is a 5 tuple $$(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{start}, q_{accept})$$
- $Q$ is a finite series of states
- $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet
- $\delta : (Q - q_{start})\times (Q - q_{accept})\rightarrow R$ is the transition function
- $q_{start}$ is the start state
- $q_{accept}$ is the accept state<!--SR:!2023-04-25,21,290!2023-04-24,20,292!2023-04-23,19,292!2023-07-28,92,312!2023-07-26,90,312!2023-04-22,18,292-->
