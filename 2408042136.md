In cryptography, an **encryption key** is a string of characters that, in combination with an encryption algorithm, scrambles and alters data seemingly randomly. Similar to a physical key, the data is sealed (encrypted) and can only be accessed once the correct key is used to unlock (decrypt) it.[^1][^2][^3]

The plaintext is encrypted by the key to create a **ciphertext**.

```
plaintext + key = ciphertext
```
## asymmetric-key encryption
**Asymmetric encryption** involves generating two keys: a private key and a public key. The public key is shared with others, while the private key must be kept confidential. The identification of "private" and "public" is arbitrary and used to differentiate the two keys; the keys may be swapped and still serve the same functions. What is important is that the keys are mathematically related.

In addition, it is not algorithmically feasible to derive one key from the other. The keys are related so that data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa. The same key cannot be used to both encrypt and decrypt.

```
A visualization of asymmetric encryption:
1. Bob encrypts a plaintext (plaintext + public key = ciphertext) 
2. Bob sends the files to Alice
3. Alice receives the file and decrypts the ciphertext (ciphertext - private key = plaintext)
```

## symmetric-key encryption
**Symmetric encryption** involves cryptography that uses a single, shared key for both encryption and decryption. If the *shared secret* becomes known to unauthorized individuals, a new key must be created.

Symmetric encryption is analogous to a typical physical key used in everyday life. The same key is used both to lock (encrypt) and unlock (decrypt) the door (encryption algorithm) keeping the contents inside sealed (ciphertext/plaintext). If the key is lost, it is best practice to replace the lock and key altogether.

## combining asymmetric and symmetric encryption
Symmetric keys can be used in tandem with asymmetric keys. For instance, if Bob and Alice each have their own private keys, Bob can combine his private key with Alice's public key to generate a symmetric key. This key would be the same as combining Alice's private key with Bob's public key. This process, known as the **Diffie-Hellman key exchange**, ensures that both parties have a shared symmetric key.
