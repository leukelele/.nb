In cryptography, an **encryption key** is a string of characters that, in combination with an encryption algorithm, scrambles and alters data seemingly randomly. Similar to a physical key, the data is sealed (encrypted) and can only be accessed once the correct key is used to unlock (decrypt) it.[^1][^2][^3]

The plaintext is encrypted by the key to create a **ciphertext**.

```
plaintext + key = ciphertext
```

## symmetric-key encryption
**Symmetric encryption** involves cryptography that uses a single, shared key for both encryption and decryption. If the *shared secret* becomes known to unauthorized individuals, a new key must be created.

Symmetric encryption is analogous to a typical physical key used in everyday life. The same key is used both to lock (encrypt) and unlock (decrypt) the door (plaintext). If the key is lost, it is best practice to replace the lock and key altogether.

While symmetric keys have less overhead than asymmetric encryption, they are often used in tandem with asymmetric keys.
