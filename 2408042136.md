In cryptography, a **key** is a string of characters that, in combination with an encryption algorithm, scrambles and alters data seemingly randomly. Similar to a physical key, the data is sealed (encrypted) and can only be accessed once the correct key is used to unlock (decrypt) it.[^1][^2][^3]

The plaintext is encrypted by the key to create a **ciphertext**.

```
plaintext + key = ciphertext
```
