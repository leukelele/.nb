In cryptography, an **encryption key** is a string of characters that, in combination with an encryption algorithm, scrambles and alters data seemingly randomly. Similar to a physical key, the data is sealed (encrypted) and can only be accessed once the correct key is used to unlock (decrypt) it.[^1][^2][^3]

The plaintext is encrypted by the key to create a **ciphertext**.

```
plaintext + key = ciphertext
```

## assymetric-key encryption
**Asymmetric encryption** involves generating two keys: a private key and a public key. The public key is shared with others, while the private key must be kept confidential. The terms "private" and "public" are arbitrary; what is important is that the keys are mathematically related. It is not possible to derive one key from the other.

The public key is used to encrypt the plaintext, while the private key is used to decrypt it. 

## symmetric-key encryption
**Symmetric encryption** involves cryptography that uses a single, shared key for both encryption and decryption. If the *shared secret* becomes known to unauthorized individuals, a new key must be created.

Symmetric encryption is analogous to a typical physical key used in everyday life. The same key is used both to lock (encrypt) and unlock (decrypt) the door (encryption algorithm) keeping the contents inside sealed (ciphertext/plaintext). If the key is lost, it is best practice to replace the lock and key altogether.

While symmetric keys have less overhead than asymmetric encryption, they are often used in tandem with asymmetric keys.
