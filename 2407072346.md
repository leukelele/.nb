Now that I have my SSH server [^1], I want to be able to access it regardless of my location; however, there is an issue. Typically, a computer's IP address is not static; instead, the end-user's IP address is assigned from a large pool available to the ISP. When the device is not in use, the IP address is returned to the pool for another device to use. To address this issue, my thought would be to make use of a DDNS [^2].

In order to establish a DDNS, however, I need to port forward my home server through my ISP's router's firewall [^1]. This step is very much dependent on the brand of the router so in this case it is preferable that you consult the router's manual. Afterwards, I went to [no-ip](https://www.noip.com/login?ref_url=console) to set up a free DDNS pointing at the public IP address provided by the port forwarding of my router. And DONE! When I `ssh` into my server, rather than:
```
$ ssh -p <port> <username>@<ip_address>
```

I can instead do:
```
$ ssh -p <port> <username>@<ddns>
```

which is far easier to remember.
