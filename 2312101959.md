1. Within the context of two senders and a router with an infinite-sized buffer, the following model would still be plagued by queue times. ![[Pasted image 20231210200001.png]]

2. In a scenario with two senders and a router with finite buffers, the design would be particularly dependent on how retransmission is carried out. Additionally, unnecessary retransmissions by the sender due to delays could result in the wastage of router bandwidth.![[Pasted image 20231210201103.png]]
