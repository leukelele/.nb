1. Within the context of two senders and a router with an infinite-sized buffer, the following model would still be plagued by queue times. ![[Pasted image 20231210200001.png]]

2. In a scenario where there are two senders and a router with finite buffers, the design would be especially dependent on how retransmission is performed. Additionally, the sender may perform unneeded retransmissions as a result of delays which would waste router bandwidth. ![[Pasted image 20231210201103.png]]

3. In a scenario where there are four senders, routers with finite buffers, and multihop paths, the increase of the throughput of one host will come at the cost of another hostâ€™s throughput.
