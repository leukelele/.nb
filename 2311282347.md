A TCP segment is formatted as follows:
![[2311282348e]] The term "32 bit" is a reference aiding in determining the size of the fields in the TCP segment.
-  *sequence number* and *acknowledge number* fields (32 bits each). used by the TCP sender/receiver to ensure reliability in data transfer
- *header length* (4 bits). specifies the length of the TCP header
- the flags:
	- *URG*. marked urgent by an upper layer
	- *ACK*. used to indicate that the value carried in the the *acknowledgement number* field is valid
	- *PSH*. indicates 
	- *RST*, *SYN*, *FIN*. used for connection setup and teardown
