A TCP [^1] segment [^2] is formatted as follows:
![[2311282348e]] The term "32 bit" is a reference aiding in determining the size of the fields in the TCP segment.
-  *sequence number* and *acknowledge number* fields (32 bits each). used by the TCP sender/receiver to ensure reliability in data transfer [^3]
- *header length* (4 bits). specifies the length of the TCP header
- the flags:
	- *URG*. marked urgent by the sender’s upper layer
	- *ACK*. used to indicate that the value carried in the the *acknowledgement number* field is valid
	- *PSH*. indicates that the segment should be pushed up the receiver’s upper layer immediately
	- *RST*, *SYN*, *FIN*. used for connection setup and teardown 
 - *receive window*. provides information to the sender about how much free buffer space is available at the receiver
 - *checksum*. verifies the integrity of the segment [^3]
 - *urgent data pointer*. the pointer to the last byte of the urgent data

[^1]: [[2311062159]] the Transmission Control Protocol is a connection-oriented (requires handshake before data transfer) and reliable data transfer protocol.
[^2]: [[2311062353]] a segment is a transport-layer packet.
[^3]: [[2311282338]] process that determines the integrity of the segment using the 1’s complement
[^4]: [[2311292101]] the sequence number acts as a counter for how many bytes have been transmitted by the sender; similarly, the acknowledgemen
