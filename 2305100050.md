The process of developing supervised machine learning [^1] begins with {{collecting historically labeled data}} that reflects features that may be important in predicting the target label. Additional data cleaning is likely necessary to ensure the quality and integrity of the data. <!--SR:!2023-09-24,10,230-->

After data cleaning, the cleaned data is then split into training and testing datasets, typically in a 70/30 or 80/20 split, respectively. The training set is used to train the machine learning model while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Different models are trained on different feature subsets from the training dataset to model a relationship. Once the model is learned, it is applied to the testing dataset. The resulting predicted values are then compared with the true values to evaluate the model's performance.

Finally, the combination of feature subset(s) and model that yield the best performance is adopted and applied to future/unseen cases. The development process my be viewed by the following graphic.
