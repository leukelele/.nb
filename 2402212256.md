# [issue] Archlinux doesn't come with hibernation
My laptop's fans sometimes run at full throttle in my backpack. I've never had this issue until using Arch Linux. 

After some research, I discovered that the feature I was looking for is referred to as "hibernation". This is, in fact, different to suspension.

- [How to Hibernate or Sleep Linux From the Command Line](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-hibernate-or-sleep-linux-from-the-command-line/)

Because of Arch's minimalistic philosophy, the hibernation feature doesn't seem to be present out-of-the-box. I'll need to set this up myself.
