# [issue] Archlinux doesn't come with hibernation
My laptop's fans sometimes run at full throttle in my backpack. I've never had this issue until using Arch Linux. 

I used the following links to come to this conclusion:
- [Power management/Suspend and hibernate](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate)
- [How to Hibernate or Sleep Linux From the Command Line](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-hibernate-or-sleep-linux-from-the-command-line/)

Because of Arch's minimalistic philosophy, the hibernation feature doesn't seem to be present out-of-the-box. I'll need to set this up myself.
