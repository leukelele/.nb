~~A notable issue I have with the current state of river is the lack of an option to put the laptop into hibernation.~~ I frequently encounter my laptop's fans running at full throttle after taking it out of my backpack. Although, I recognize this may just be ~~specific to the distro flavor and~~ issues with my own lack of knowledge. I have found some articles that may shed some light on the issue:
- [Power management/Suspend and hibernate](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate) [^1]
- [How to Hibernate or Sleep Linux From the Command Line](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-hibernate-or-sleep-linux-from-the-command-line/)

[^1]: Upon further reading in the ArchWiki, I realized that my prior expectations were likely influenced by the KDE and GNOME developers, who designed their desktops to include such features.
