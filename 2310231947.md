A $2^{n}\times 1$ **multiplexer (MUX)** selects binary information from $2^n$ inputs and routes the data into a single output line. The multiplexer is represented as follows ![[2310231950e]]
- the selection line composes a bit combination that corresponds to the address of the selected input; $S_{n-1}$ to $S_0$ represent the *most significant bit* and *least significant bit*, respectively.
