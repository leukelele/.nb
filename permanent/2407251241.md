# configuring SSH-based authentication on a Debian server

There are various methods for authenticating on an SSH server, with password authentication being the default. However, this default method is not the most secure approach. In terms of both convenience and security, SSH key-based authentication is a better option in both regards.[^1]

In key-based authentication, the private key stays on the client device, while the public key is shared with the server. When the server issues a challenge, the client uses its private key to generate a response. The server then uses the public key to verify the response's validity.[^2] Even if a malicious actor intercepts all challenge-response pairs, they cannot deduce future responses without the private key. This method ensures that even if the server is compromised, the private key remains secure, adding another level of security to the user.

In addition, aside from the initial setup, all subsequent logins do not require entering a password each time. This enhances productivity by reducing the number of interruptions during tasks. Overall, it make authorization less tedious.

## creating an SSH key-pair

First, if an SSH key does not already exist, it needs to be generated on the client device using `ssh-keygen`, which is included in the `openssh` package. By default, OpenSSH versions 9.5 and above will generate an ed25519 key pair.[^3]

```
$ ssh-keygen

Generating public/private [ALGORITHM] key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_[ALGORITHM]): []
```

At this prompt, you can specify a nonstandard path for placing the keys. Otherwise (and is recommended), pressing `ENTER` will save the keys in the default location: `/home/username/.ssh/id_[ALGORITHM]`. In `~/.ssh`, the private key will be called `id_[ALGORITHM]` and the associated public key will be called `id_[ALGORITHM].pub`. Under no circumstances should the private key be shared.

Afterwards, the user will be prompted to input a secure passphrase on top of the SSH keys. A passphrase is recommended but not required. The passphrase adds an extra layer of security; however, the private key itself is never exposed to the network and is protected by file permissions, meaning it should only be accessible to the user (and root).[^4]

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): []
Enter same passphrase again: []
```

## copying the public key onto the server

The next step after generating a key pair is to copy the public key (the file with the `.pub` extension in `~/.ssh`) onto the server. Several methods exist for this, including manually copying the key onto the server. However, the `OpenSSH` package includes a utility called `ssh-copy-id` to simplify this process.

`ssh-copy-id` requires specifying the remote host, using syntax similar to `ssh`. For this method to work, password-based SSH access must be enabled.

```
$ ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
```

The following message may also appear, to which input `yes`:

```
The authenticity of host '[HOSTNAME/IP ADDR] ([IP ADDR])' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is [FINGERPRINT].
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? [yes]
```

On the local (client) machine, the file `known_hosts` in `~/.ssh` will be updated to include the new host (remote). The utility will then look for the saved public key `id_[ALGORITHM].pub` and prompt a password for the user's account on the SSH server.

```
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
username@remote_host's password: []
```

Upon successful authentication, the contents of the public key is copied into the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote host with the following, or similar, message:

```
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'user@remote_host'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

## disabling password authentication

By default, password-based authentication remains active on the SSH server, leaving it exposed to brute-force attacks.[^4] To disable password authentication, the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file must be configured accordingly. This process will require root privileges.

Inside the file, there should be a directive `PasswordAuthentication`. It should be set to `no`.

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Once the changes have been saved, restart the SSH Daemon in order to apply the changes.

```
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

[^1]: In hindsight, the phrase "In terms of both convenience and security... key-based authentication... is a better option in both regards" is rather ambiguous. Aside from the initial setup for key-based auth, there won't be a requirement for password input each time you try to access the ssh server. The security aspect is indeed better, as justified in [[2407251026]].
