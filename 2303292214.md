![[2302090051e]]The diagram, similar to the example in [[2303222228]], is a **state diagram** and provides a visual for the finite automaton [^1]. The diagram has three *states* q$_{1}$, q$_{2}$, and q$_{3}$.
- The *start state* q$_{1}$ is indicated by the arrow of no distinct origin. The *accept state* (final state) q$_{2}$ is one with double circles. The arrows going from one state to another are called **transitions**.
- Depending on the input string, the output resolves to be either *accept* or *reject*. <!--SR:!2023-12-07,196,270!2025-02-04,513,290-->
