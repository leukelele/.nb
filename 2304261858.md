In consideration for the summation described in [[2304261804]], the minimum summation may be found by applying the gradient [^1] to the summation and setting the gradient to 0, which results in the following system $$\left[\begin{align*}
\sum \limits_i2x_i(\alpha x_{i} + \beta - y_i) \\ 
2\sum\limits_i(\alpha x_{i} + \beta - y_i)^2 \\ 
\end{align*}\right] = 0$$

The systems of equation produces the following equations $$\alpha = \frac{\sum\limits_ix_iy_{i-}\sum\limits_ix_i\sum\limits_iy_i}{\sum\limits_ix_{i^2}-(\sum\limits_ix_i)^2}$$ $$\beta = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_iy_{i}-\alpha \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_ix_i$$
