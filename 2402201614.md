I encountered issues updating and refreshing packages on a new Archcraft installation, where the error message displayed was:
```bash
invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)
```

The suggested solution indicated by the [post installation](https://wiki.archcraft.io/docs/install-archcraft/post-install) tab indicated to run the following commands: 
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring
$ sudo pacman-key --init
$ sudo pacman-key --populate
```

However, the same messages appear; I found that the following command should first be ran before the preceding commands:
```bash
gpgconf --kill all
```
