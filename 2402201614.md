# ArchCraft post installation issues

After I tried to refresh the package database and update the fresh installation with
```
$ sudo pacman -Syyu
```

I encountered an issue where I would receive the error message:
```bash
invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)
```

## solution
The suggested solution for this is to run the following commands:[^1]
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring
$ sudo pacman-key --init
$ sudo pacman-key --populate
```

However, the same message would appear. The issue is resolved by running this command first before the suggested solution:[^2]
```bash
$ gpgconf --kill all
```

[^1]: The ArchCraft wiki has a tab on [post installation](https://wiki.archcraft.io/docs/install-archcraft/post-install) and this was where I found the suggested solution.
[^2]: The command kills all GnuPG background processes.
