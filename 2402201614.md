# ArchCraft post installation issues

After I tried to refresh the package database and update the fresh installation with
```
$ sudo pacman -Syyu
```

I encountered an issue where I will receive the error message
```bash
invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)
```

The suggested solution for this is to run the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring
$ sudo pacman-key --init
$ sudo pacman-key --populate
```

However, the same messages appear; I found that the following command should first be ran before the prior commands:
```bash
$ gpgconf --kill all
```

It basically kills all GnuPG background processes. [^1]

[^1]: What are GnuPG processes and gpgconf?
