A *DNS message* is a standardized format for communication between the resolver and the servers involved in a DNS query. 

There are two types of DNS messages (both of which follow a similar format):
- query message
- response message

The format consists of five sections
- *header*.
	- *identification*. 16 bit number
	- *flags*. indicates: query or reply, recursion desired, recursion available, authority reply
- *question*. name, type fields for query
- *answer records*. records in response to query
- *authority records*. records for authoritative servers
- *additional records*. helpful information
