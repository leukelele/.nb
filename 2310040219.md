The **World Wide Web (WWW)** is a system that operates in the highest network layer - that is, the application layer [^1]. It commonly consists of:
- web pages composed of objects of various types (HTML, JPEG, audio files, etc.) 
- *hyperlinked documents*. links that allow for navigating between web pages
- *Uniform Resource Locator (URL)*. an identifier that contains enough information to access a resource in the WWW
