- stack up and down
- stack-cookie-3
	- stack smashing
- last stack is more buffer-overflow related
- dep-1
	- overflow then call `some_function` 
	- crash it first by overflowing the buffer
	- Core(./core)
	- when crashing you cyclic(500).find(b’addr of eip’) to find the size of the buffer
	- prof suggest buffer = 0x88 then addr of some function
	- `some_funnction` calls `ls`
	- `export PATH=.:$PATH` so that some_function is symlinked to ls
- dep-2
	- `p1 = proces(e.path)`
	- `p1.libc.functions[’system’]`
	- `hex(p1.libc.functions[’system’])` 
	- `c = Core(./core)`
	- `c.maps`
- dep-3
	- open an ‘a.txt’
	- symlink to a.txt
	- read should be 3 instead of 0
```python
(ELF).plt[‘something‘]
```

- `vmmap`
- 4 leak the puts, GOT
