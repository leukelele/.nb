Given the dataset described by [[2304250226]], the **residual** is found by identifying a point $y_i$ from the dataset and determining the difference from the line $\alpha x_i + \beta$ (where the point should be in the line) to the point $y_i$, which may be represented as follows $$\alpha x_{i} + \beta - y_i$$ <!--SR:!2024-03-12,190,270-->

In simpler terms, the residual may be found by subtracting the predicted value $\alpha x_{i} + \beta$  by the observed value $y_i$. 

A *positive residual* indicates the predicted value to be greater than the observed value, and a *negative residual* indicates the observed value to be greater.
