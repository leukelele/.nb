The internetâ€™s network layer protocol, ***Internet Protocol (IP)*** [^1], follows a "best effort delivery service" model. There is no guarantee of maintaining integrity, order, or successful delivery of transmitted segments.

Within this model, each host has at least one network-layer address - ***IP address***.
