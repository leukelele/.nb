Assume there exists a dataset described by [[202304250226]], and the preceding processes of 
- [[202304261755]] finding the residual
- [[202304261756]] squaring the residual

The {{summation of the squared residuals}} $\sum\limits_i(\alpha x_{i} + \beta - y_i)^2$ identifies the exaggerated difference between the predicted model and the observed data.  <!--SR:!2023-09-08,7,190-->
