What methods should be considered when panicking about a test?
??
- Reinterpret the symptoms; rather than saying, "I am feeling nervous about this test," a different interpretation might be, "this feeling I have currently is because I am excited."
- Momentarily focus on your own breathing, which may be done so by placing your hand on your stomach and taking a deep breath.
- Another approach is to practice mindfulness; be able to distinguish naturally arising thoughts and emotional projections that often tag along the initial thought. <!--SR:!2024-11-02,633,290-->
