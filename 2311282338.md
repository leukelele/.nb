A ***checksum*** is a method for verifying that data was not altered during its transit towards its destination.

On the side of the sender, a checksum is created:
1. break the message into $k$ blocks with $n$ bits
2. find the sum of all blocks
3. for any carry, add it to the sum
4. find the 1’s complement of the sum => checksum

On the side of the receiver, the checksum is compared with the payload:
1. break the payload into $k$ blocks with $n$ bits 
2. find the sum of all the blocks
3. for any carry, add it to the sum
4. find the sum of the payload and the checksum
5. if the resulting sum are all 1’s then accept; otherwise, reject
