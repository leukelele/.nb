A *card play* can be one of the following:
- A card will be represented by a 3-element list in which: the first element is the atom `'card` , the second is the cardâ€™s suit, and the third is the value of the card.
- The wild card, or king [^1].
- A pair is a two element list where the elements are cards that are matching values that equate to 10 as to indicate to the game that the player desires to play the pair of cards as valued 10 [^1].
