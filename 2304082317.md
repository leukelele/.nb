There lies many difficulties when creating a modded Minecraft server on Linux; though, a majority of which comes from my own inexperience. From what I have collected thus far, there are a couple of steps that have remained consistent throughout:
1. [[2304082331]] install the Minecraft Forge server.
2. [[2304111741]] modify the `run` script
3. Execute the `run` script. It will produce an error upon its first execution; a EULA file should now be present in the directory. Open the file with a text editor and change `false` to `true` to agree to the EULA. Rerun the script.

Thus concludes the setup of the server and what remains is setting up a method such that others may access the server. This requires **port forwarding** which allows remote devices to access a device on a private network. <!--SR:!2023-11-03,162,290-->
