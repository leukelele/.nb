Typically the general process a TCP connection follows for probing the network for congestion is to first follow the:
- ***TCP slow start***. Beginning at a congestion window (CWND) of 1 maximum segment size (MSS) and doubling it every RTT. Once a loss has been indicated by a timeout, it should the follow the
- ***AMID*** approach. the window increases linearly rather than exponentially

Lost is indicated by 3 duplicate ACKs - TCP reno, in which the TCP connection follows the AMID approach. TCP tahoe always sets the window to 1.
