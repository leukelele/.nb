Regardless, with recent developments in AI (as of March 2023), it is clear that - to some degree - perfect emulation is not necessary to overtake specific aspects of humanity [^1][^2].

I recall having heard many arguments - though, I am not too sure from where - that it will never be possible for machines to emulate the artistic elements of humanity; yet, through Machine Learning alone, it feels as if the subject may simply be reduced to statistics. As long as there exist identifying patterns current technologies may potentially emulate or reconstruct it.
