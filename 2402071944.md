So I recently discovered [Archcraft](https://archcraft.io/), which is essentially Arch Linux pre-configured with (mostly) tasteful aesthetics. While many options were appealing, I ultimately chose the configured [riverWM](https://github.com/riverwm/river) because I've never used river before.

I have found that within the installation they have an interesting approach to theming [^1] where the colors of the waybar and other details are reconfigured to match the major colors of the wallpaper.

Aside from the small tweaks here and there, it has definitely been a time saver because it prevents me from trying to reconfigure vanilla installations.
