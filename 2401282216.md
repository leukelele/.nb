In assembly languages, there are two common syntaxes: AT&T (primarily used in UNIX/Linux systems) and Intel (used in Microsoft and other environments). The divergence in approaches is rooted in the development of conventions specific to each company. 

Typically, the differences between Intel and AT&T syntax are: 
- ***operand order***.
	- *AT&T*. Source operand is on the left while the destination operand is on the right.
	- *Intel*. Source operand is on the right while the destination operand is on the left.
- ***prefixes***.
