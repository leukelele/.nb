## question
How is a statistical machine learning algorithm different from a machine learning algorithm?
## evidence
- a statistical machine learning algorithm [^1] describes a ML model that emulates, NOT replicate, the real world given some input data
- a machine learning algorithm is more general in that it encompasses the statistical machine learning algorithm
- take for example linear regression [^2], it may be used in the context of statistical applications but it also has its uses in regression tasks beyond the scope of the statistical context.

## conclusion
It is not different but rather a specialization of machine learning aside from its emphasis towards statistical principles, which is inherently is part of machine learning.
