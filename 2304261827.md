Often the intent for a machine learning model [^1] is for {{its ability to make predictions}}. Likewise, the algorithms are designed to {{identify patterns in data}} in order to {{make predictions or decisions for new, unseen data}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-26,179,270!2023-11-09,72,270!2024-01-20,144,230-->

Of the algorithms [^2] that act as the building block for supervised machine learning models [^3], a prominent algorithm commonly used is the linear regression model [^4] [^5], which is applies to {{quantitative}} data. When faced with a problem, linear regression should be the first algorithm considered. <!--SR:!2024-05-14,243,288-->
