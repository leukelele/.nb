Scaling the DPI with `wlr-randr` results in a very obvious difference in cursor size and theme. Instead, I found `kanshi` to be a better solution. In addition, the new app provides profiles for multiple displays [^1]. The cursor size, however, is still somewhat inconsistent across apps. Admittdely, this doesn’t affect performance, but it is an annoying cosmetic issue that I find it hard to ignore. 

This appears to be an ongoing issue:
