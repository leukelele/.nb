**Bottleneck link** describes the phenomena in which the average may be determined by the minimum of the involved throughput rates. The bottleneck link could be described in relation to water pipes; throughput could be thought of as the size of the pipe. Regardless of the size of the pipes, the amount of water that traverses through the pipes is limited by the smallest pipe - that is, if $T_{1}> T_2$ then the water that passes through $T_1$ can only amount as such regardless of the size of $T_2$; if $T_{1}< T_2$, a similar issue would occur.
