The concept of nondeterminism [^1] allows for proof that the union [^2], concatenation [^3], and star [^4] of regular languages are still regular. Regardless, this idea will remain as a blackbox and the results of the proofs exist in the following nodes:
- ![[2303291725]]
- ![[2303291728]]
- ![[2303291727]]

[^1]: [[2305221245]] desc. of NFA.
[^2]: [[2303291725]] desc. of union operation.
[^3]: [[2303292149]] desc. of concatenation operation.
[^4]: [[2303292150]]  desc. of star operation.
