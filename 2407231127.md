After conducting further surface-level research, I now realize that while the reasonings found in [[2407221733]] make sense, they are not necessarily applicable to the current instance of my server. To clarify, there is currently only one device within my home network. A moderately large undertaking, such as setting up a VPN server, has very little advantage.

The issues with ssh mentioned earlier may still be present with a VPN; although, it's difficult to say with complete confidence as I have not yet set up a VPN server. A more practical approach might be to harden the current mechanism [^1] of the server before adding additional layers of complexity.

[^1]: The current mechanism that I am referring to is the singular method of authentication through `ssh` [[2407071505]].
