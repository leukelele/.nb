After conducting further surface-level research, I now realize that while the reasonings found in [[2407221733]] make sense, they are not necessarily applicable to the current instance of my server. To clarify, there is currently only one device within my home network. A moderately large undertaking, such as setting up a VPN server, has very little advantage.

Additionally, the issues with `ssh` mentioned prior may still be present with a VPN; although, it is difficult for me to say with complete confidence as I have not yet set up a VPN server. For now, let's first enhance `ssh` before adding more layers of security. With my current level of knowledge, it is best that I keep everything simple before making my security complex.
