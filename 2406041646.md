- ***Encryption***. the readable data is scrambled in a manner that is no longer human decipherable; viewing the data will require decryption
- ***Access Controls***. refers to access management activities that aims to allow only authorized users to view the information
	- ***Identification***. the user claims an ID
	- ***Authentication***. the user provides their ID and associated credentials required for accessing the restricted information 
	- ***Authorization***. access is then granted or restricted depending on the level of permissions allowed to the specific user
