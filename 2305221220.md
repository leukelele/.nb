A **deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** is a type of finite state machine with a key characteristic: when a machine is given a state and reads the next input symbol, the next state is known - it is determined. It is commonly represented by a 5-tuple. [^1] <!--SR:!2024-03-08,185,254-->

The 5-tuple, representing a finite automaton, is presented as follows, in order:
- $Q$, is a finite set of **states**
- $\Sigma$ is the finite set of symbols called the **alphabet**, which defines the allowed input(s) that may be formed
- $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ [^2] is the **transition function**, which defines the rules for moving from one state to another
- $q_{0}\in Q$ is the **start state**
- $F\subseteq Q$ is the **set of accept states** <!--SR:!2023-12-29,171,288!2024-01-02,175,288!2023-12-30,172,288!2024-04-01,204,258!2023-12-06,88,278-->

It is possible for there to be {{0}} accept states in a finite automaton, which may be done so by {{establishing the finite automaton $F$ as an empty set $\emptyset$}}. Additionally, it should be noted that the transition function $\delta$ specifies that there is exactly {{one next state}} for each possible combination of state and input symbol. <!--SR:!2023-12-08,197,270!2023-12-13,155,250!2023-10-20,41,230-->
