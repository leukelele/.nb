Ensuring resource availability often may be restricted by security constraints [^1]. 

> For instance, if encrypting data increases the number of characters by about 60%, each data element will occupy approximately 60% more disk space. Additionally, encrypting and decrypting data also requires additional processing power.

> Two-factor authentication (2FA) is another example that highlights this balance. While choosing not to use 2FA would speed up the login process, the trade-off would be an increased likelihood of a malicious actor gaining access to important credentials through brute force.
