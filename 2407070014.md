As a fun project, I decided to create a home server using a spare PC I had lying around. The first task was deciding which OS to install on the server. This involved many considerations, but foremost, the server needed stability. When it comes to stability, Debian is the first OS that comes to mind.

I was already familiar with installing GNU/Linux, so creating the installation media was a breeze for me [^1]. However, a surprising number of issues came up, and I discovered a newfound hatred for HP.

First, a bit of context: the spare PC is a prebuilt "HP gaming PC" that I bought during my time of inexperience with computer hardware. Most of its parts are HP-branded, including the motherboard. Typically, you want to boot into the BIOS to rearrange the boot order [^2] or, if possible, go straight to the boot manager menu and select your installation media. However, trying to boot into the BIOS was pure frustration, as it would always return a blank screen. I assumed that the issue was related to needing to replug my monitor into the motherboard's ports rather than the GPU's, but that did not solve the issue. The issue would continue to persist despite incremental changes in the hardware being used.

Ultimately, the solution I found was using the OS to assist with booting into the BIOS, which, surprisingly, Windows offered. Once I was finally able to boot into the installation media, I went through each step of the installer, opting for a more minimal, desktop-less installation as it has become my preference [^3]. It also felt more appropriate for optimizing the space in a server.

[^1]: While I might be very familiar with this step, that doesn't mean that others are. The following guides, from what I can tell, are good for showing the step-by-step processing of creating an installation media of your choosing: [linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-a-bootable-linux-usb-drive/) [Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#3-usb-selection)
