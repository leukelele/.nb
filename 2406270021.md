In the the [Google Cybersecurity course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/supplement/vwtuq/transferable-and-technical-cybersecurity-skills), they mention transferable skills that you should check that my resume contain:
- **communication**. the ability to bridge technical and non-technical knowledge
- **time management**. know what to prioritize
- **problem-solving**. common analyst tasks are to identify and solve problems
- **growth mindset**. in a continuously evolving industry, it is important to be willing to learn
- **diverse perspectives**. respect one another's views

Continually, there are technical skills that you should practice and develop:
??
- **programming languages**. for automation [^1]
- **security information and event management (SIEM) tools**. tools that collectand analyze log data, or record of events [^2]
- **intrusion detection systems**. monitor system activity and alerts for possible intrusions [^2]
- **threat landscape knowledge**. being aware of current trends [^3]
- **incident response**. be able to appropriately react to incidents 

[^1]: If it's just for automation, then all that I need is Python; however, I suspect that having knowledge of C/C++ and/or Rust would also be very helpful.
[^2]: What sort of tools are these? What's popular?
[^3]: Where would I go to keep up with current trends? It's obvious that malicious actors would not have a social media specific to them.
