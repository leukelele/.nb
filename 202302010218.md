What are the 4 steps that compose a habit? ::: The cue, routine, reward, and belief. <!--SR:!2025-04-04,786,336-->

```ad-example
Imagine a situation where you find yourself about to do your homework. You finally gain the courage to start on the homework and you find yourself either bored or uncomfortable, so you rationalize yourself into getting on your phone for 20 minutes. The 20 minutes becomes hours. Initially, you had thought that by getting on your phone, you would somehow find the time to do the assignment at a later time or that you would eventually get into the mood of doing the assignment.
- The cue is the homework; specifically, the boredom or uncomfort that was produced from the homework.
- The routine is the subsequent usage of the phone.
- The reward is the small bursts of dopamine as a result of the contents of the phone.
- The belief is that you will either eventually get into the mood of doing the assignment or complete the assignment at a later time.
