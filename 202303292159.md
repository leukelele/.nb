How might chunking be similar to a generalization? ::: A generalization strips the unnecessary details of some information such that it retains only the most important pattern; a chunk compresses the collected information in such a manner that the collection is stripped of most of its unnecessary information in favor for identified consistent patterns. The generalization, just like a chunk, is applicable to any like-situations. <!--SR:!2025-06-26,871,330-->
