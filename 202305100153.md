**Reinforcement machine learning algorithm** describes machine learning [^1] algorithms that involve an agent that learns and makes decisions within some environment that would maximize a cumulative reward - typically emulating the method of trial-and-error. <!--SR:!2024-02-13,168,270-->

Reinforcement learning is composed of three components:
- the *agent*, which learns and makes decisions,
- the *environment*, which the agent interacts with, and
- the *actions*, which are possible responses inherent to the agent.
