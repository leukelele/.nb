Given a set of pairs [^1], the following model represents the collection as a linear combination of features: $$f_{w,b}(x)=wx+b$$where $w$ is the D-dimensional vector of the parameters, and $b$ is a real number. The notation $f_{w,b}$ is the model $f$ parameterized by $w$ and $b$. The model is known as a **linear regression** [^2].

Relative to the collection provided, the best fit - that is, the most optimal values for $w^*$ and $b^*$ - may be found in [[2304250253]].

[^1]: [[2304250226]] the set of pairs may be described similarly to the ref. node.
[^2]: [[2304250223]] a type of regression described by its ability to described patterns linearly.
