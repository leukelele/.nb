A **statistical learning machine** is an inductive inference machine [^1] with the goal of approximating real world scenarios; the approximation is built upon a collection of data that the machine learned from. The model is fundamentally probabilistic [^2].

The framework that it is built is as follows

[^1]: [[2309261828]] which is to say that the machine does not begin informed
[^2]: [[2303221754]] it is reminiscent of a conclusion drawn from an AI textbook
