A little while after I had completed setting up the DDNS for my server [^1], I realized a major security issue that required me to keep my server powered off until I could find a solution. In its current state, it wouldn't be surprising if someone gained access to the server. One conceivable method could involve scraping the public internet for SSH connections and then conducting a brute force attack to discover the username and password to access my server.

Regardless of method, it would be prudent that the server remained down in the meanwhile. So, I started thinking of how corporate/university networks are generally managed; for matters that require access to confidential company resources, a VPN is often used.

What security advantages come with requiring a VPN? 
- Access control [^2] as they typically follow the steps of identification -> authentication -> authorization.
- Encrypted data is transmitted across an alternative network other than those provided by your ISP and allows for unified access across corporate/university branches irrespective to physical location
- Mitigates some issues that arise when employees connect to public WiFi networks 

It is only logical that I should begin with setting up a VPN server.

[^1]: In [[2407072346]], I summarize the process of setting up the DDNS. It would be nice to have a more detailed explanation of the whole process; however, this results in a security issue. Maybe I will write in more detail another time.
