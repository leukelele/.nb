Additionally, scalability and elasticity are important factors in availability:
- **horizontal scalability**. refers to the increase capacity to meed new demand (e.g. adding more servers to meet increasing demand)
- **vertical scalability**. refers to the addition of resources (e.g. adding more RAM).
- **elasticity**. automates the scalability according to the current demands of the system
