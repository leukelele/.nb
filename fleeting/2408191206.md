There is already an exceptional guide on this topic already (which is further coroborated by other guides); however, as someone with less than the implied knowledge in this article, I will go about learning and explaining the unfamiliar concepts.

install docker and docker-compose:
- first req.: 
    - update
    - apt-transport-https: for downloading repos via HTTPS
        - It is available by default since apt 1.5 and was available before that in the package apt-transport-https. Note that a transport is never called directly by a user but used by APT tools based on user configuration. https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/apt/apt-transport-https.1.en.html
    - ca-certificates: Contains the certificate authorities shipped with Mozilla's browser to allow SSL-based applications to check for the authenticity of SSL connections. Debian can neither confirm nor deny whether the certificate authorities whose certificates are included in this package have in any way been audited for trustworthiness or RFC 3647 compliance.https://packages.debian.org/sid/ca-certificates
    - curl: for transferring data with URL syntax https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/curl
    - gnupg: allows to encrypt and sign your data and communication
    https://wiki.debian.org/GnuPG


- ca-cert already installed
