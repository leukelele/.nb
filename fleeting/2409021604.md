firew = net sec dev that monitor traffic, allows or blocks
- may use port filtering = blocking certain ports

hardware firewall = inspects each dt packet before entering net; softw firew is the same but is instead a software
- the weakness of softw however is that it will burden the sys -> cloud based option

stateful/stateless = keeps track of info and proactively monitoring; works based on preconfig rules and does not analyze info

NGFW = deep packet inspection, intrusion protection, threat intel.
