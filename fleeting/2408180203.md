The requirements that I will need for an SSH honeypot are
- program listens to a port
    - figure out socket programming in c
    - test for connection between server and client
- accept "ssh" connections
    - how to recognize an ssh connection attempt
- loop itself to allow multiple attempts
    - loop itself or spawn child processes
- log the attempts
