# step by step breakdown of how to create an ssh honeypot
- understanding the SSH protocol:
    - SSH handshake
    - typical SSH session commands and behaviors
    - auth
- ssh honeypot componenets:
    - bind to port 22; accept connections
        - socket programming
    - ssh session emulation
        - fake handshake and auth
        - track commands
        - fake responses
    - logging
        - IP addr, timestamp, etc.
        - log commands
        - capture and analyze errors in behaviors
    - fake auth
* make sure app is runnign in isolation
* consider using test units

## dev log
### 2409042059
```
Error listening to socket: ECDSA, ED25519, DSA, or RSA host key file must be set
```
This shows up with the "init commit use with libssh", this comes as a result a result that I guess to be because I had not set up some method of including a key file of sorts for a connection as this is typically what is exchanged in an ssh connection.
