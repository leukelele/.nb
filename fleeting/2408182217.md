how to protect org data and assets; use Open Web App Sec Proj (OWASP) guidelines:
- minimize attack surface - all potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited
- principle of least privilege
- defense in depth - org should have multiple sec controls that address risks in different ways
- separate of duties - no one should be given too many priv
- keep sec simple - no unnecessary complexity -> unman
- fix issues correctly - correct vuln and test

additionally:
- secure defaults - extra steps to be insecure
- fail securely - default to most secure option if ctrl fails
- don't trust services
- avoid security by obscurity

*don't bother with overwhelming yourself
