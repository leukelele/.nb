Cybersecurity is like preparing for a stormâ€”it's not about the "bells and whistles," but about what truly gets the job done. Typical tools that may be used in the field are:
- **SIEM tools**. apps that collect and analyze log data to monitor system activities
- **playbooks**. manuals for operational action, such as responding to a security incident. There are many types of playbooks:
    - *chain of custody*. documentation of evidence possession and control during an incident's lifetime
    - *protecting and preserving evidence*. instructions for how to properly preserve fragile and volatile evidence
        - *order of volatility*. outlines the order data must be preserved from first to last
- **Packet sniffer**. capture and analyze network packets
- **SQL**. a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.
- **Intrusion detection system (IDS)** monitors network activity for patterns that resemble an intrusion, often using a packet sniffer to analyze data traffic.
