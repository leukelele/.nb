# vaultwarden

Vaultwarden is a reimplementation of Bitwarden in the Rust programming language, designed to offer greater flexibility. Bitwarden's self-hosting option is distributed in a containerized form, which is essentially a one-size-fits-all solution and may not include all its features immediately out of the box, though the overall service and support is reportedly excellent. Vaultwarden, on the other hand, allows for more customization in installation and has less overhead.[^1] While Bitwarden, built on Microsoft's tech stack with .NET and MySQL, requires around 2 GB of memory, Vaultwarden reportedly uses only about 60 MB.[^2] However, unlike Bitwarden, Vaultwarden does not include a reverse proxy by default, requiring manual setup for that component.

## prerequisites

The setup guide will use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which typically comes separate from Docker. Docker operates similarly to virtual machines but runs containers that share the host operating system and virtualize only at the software level. This approach offers advantages in portability and security. Details on its benefits, however, will be kept minimal in this guide. Personally, I elected to use Docker as means for practicing with the application.

### installing docker on Debian 12

Docker is available in the official Debian repositories and can be installed using APT. However, this version may not always be the latest. For the most up-to-date version, it's preferable to download Docker directly from the official repository.

#### Step 1: Update the package index and install prerequisites

These prerequisites are necessary to add and use a new HTTPS repository, specifically the Docker repository.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

#### Step 2: Import the GPG repository key

This ensures the authenticity of the Docker software.

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

#### Step 3: Add the Docker repository

Add the Docker repository to the system and refresh the package list.

```bash
$ echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian bookworm stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
$ sudo apt update
```

#### Step 4: Install Docker

Finally, install Docker with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
- `docker-ce`: The Docker engine itself.
- `docker-ce-cli`: A command-line tool for interacting with the Docker daemon.
- `containerd.io`: A container runtime that manages the lifecycle of containers.
- `docker-buildx-plugin`: A CLI plugin that extends Docker build capabilities with additional features.
- `docker-compose-plugin`: A CLI plugin for Docker Compose.

### installing docker compose

The following installs `docker compose` and ensures that it is executable.

```bash
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-linux-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
