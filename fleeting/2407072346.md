Now that I have my SSH server [^1], I want to be able to access it regardless of my location; however, there is an issue. Typically, a computer's IP address is not static; instead, the end-user's IP address is assigned from a large pool available to the ISP. When the device is not in use, the IP address is returned to the pool for another device to use. To address this issue, my thought would be to make use of a DDNS [^2].

In order to establish a DDNS, however, I need to port forward my home server through my ISP's router firewall. This step largely depends on the router's brand, so consulting the router's manual is advisable in this case. Afterward, I visited [no-ip](https://www.noip.com/login?ref_url=console) to set up a free DDNS pointing to the public IP address provided by my router's port forwarding. And it's done! Now when I `ssh` into my server, instead of:
```
$ ssh -p <port> <username>@<ip_address>
```

I can instead do:
```
$ ssh -p <port> <username>@<ddns>
```

which is far easier to remember.

[^2]: [This article](https://www.howtogeek.com/866573/what-is-dynamic-dns-ddns-and-how-do-you-set-it-up/) provides a good introduction into what a DDNS is; although, I did not at all follow the tutorial on how to set it up through this site.
