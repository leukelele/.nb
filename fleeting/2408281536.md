net proto = set of rules that det. order of delivery and struct. of dt. over network

Comm proto:
- TCP = establish direction between endpts
- UDP
- HTTPS/HTTP = app layer that allow comm. bw website server and client
- DNS = human readable addr

management proto:
- snmp = net proto for examining devices on net
- icmp = inform devices of dt trans. error across net

sec proto:
- HTTPS
- SFTP

- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) = net proto used to det. MAC of next device in path
- SSL/TLs

NAT translates dt coming into public address and determines where dt should go among the private IP addr.s in the LAN


DHCP - UDP 67 (servers); UDP 68 (clients)
ARP - none
Telnet - TCP 23
SSH - TCP 22
POP3 - TCP/UDP 110 (unencrypted); TCP/UDP 995 (encrypted, SSL/TLS)
IMAP - TCP 143 (unencrypted); TCP 993 (encrypted, SSL/TLS)
SMTP - TCP/UDP 25 (unencrypted)
SMTPS - TCP/UDP 587 (encrypted, TLS)
