By increasing redundancy, the system becomes more **fault-tolerant**, allowing services to continue without immediate issues when specific mechanisms fail. This can be achieved through:
- **disk redundancy**. fault-tolerant disks (e.g., RAID [^1]) allow a system to continue functioning even if a disk were to fail.
- **server redundancy**. failover clusters enable the system to switch from a failed server to a redundant server within the same cluster.
- **network redundancy**. load balancing often utilizes multiple servers and network interface cards (NICs), providing redundancy support and increased bandwidth by employing two or more NICs in a single server.
- **power redundancy**. uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and power generators supply power to key systems in case of commercial power failure.

[^1]: What exactly is RAID? Iâ€™m guessing it has nothing to do with the roach spray.
