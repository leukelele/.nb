Computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) [^1] must be at least be aware of the most common methods of attacks:
- **phishing**. the use of digital communication to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malware [^2]
- **malware**. software design to harm devices within a network [^3]
- **social engineering**. the use of manipulation to exploit human error to gain sensitive information [^4]

[^1]: The establishment of the CSIRT was a result of prior cybersecurity attacks: the LoveLetter attack, ILOVEYOU virus, and Morris worm.
[^2]: Phishing may be further described by its approach as described by [[2407040222]].
[^3]: The most common types of malware are viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware; as described in [[2407040230]].
[^4]: [[2407040243]] lists just some of the ways that social engineering exploits human error; in this way, phishing is essential a subcategory of social engineering.
