**Availability** ensures that data and services are accessible when needed.[^1]  This can be improved through the implementation of redundancy and fault tolerance, as well as by keeping the system up-to-date with current patches.[^2] **Fault tolerance** refers to a system's ability to continue operating despite experiencing a fault.[^3]

While increasing fault tolerance is likely to raise the **total cost of ownership (TCO)**, a common goal is to reduce the number of **single points of failure (SPOF)**. For example, if a server has only a single drive, that drive is a SPOF because if it fails, the entire server will be taken down. However, current trends focus on enhancing the system’s resilience—that is, its ability to recover from a fault.

[^1]: This node expands upon the CIA security triad [[2406041346]], though with an evident focus on availability.
[^2]: As indicated by [[2406302106]], there are multiple ways for implementing/increasing redudancy. 
[^3]: There are also factors like scalability and elasticity, mentioned in [[2406302118]], that determine the system's capabilities in maintaining current operations before requiring other considerations.
