Fundamentally, a computer problem may be summarized as {{a set of procedures t}}



Computer problems come in large varieties, some are difficult while others are very easy. Regardless, in a computing environment, its resolution follows some {{set of procedures that convert an input into an output}}. When confronted by computationally difficult problems, there are several approaches:
??
- understand the root (of the problem) that is the cause for the difficulties and alter it to make it solvable
- develop an approximate solution
- some problems are only difficult in the worst case, but easy in other cases
- potentially consider alternative types of computation <!--SR:!2023-12-17,207,290-->
