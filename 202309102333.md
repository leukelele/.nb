## question
What is a statistical machine learning algorithm?
## evidence
- an inductive inference machine (- machines that learn by example) [^1] as opposed to deductive inference machines [^3].
- built on framework of probabilistic inductive logic [^4]

[^1]: what does it mean for the machine to learn by example? That it is learning from labeled data? In which case, does that not mean that it is simply just a supervised learning machine [^2] ?
