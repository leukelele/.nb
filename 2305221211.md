A **finite state machine (FSM)**, or finite automaton, is a mathematical model that describes a system that operates in a sequence of discrete steps and transitions between states based on the given input. A FSM contains five common components: states, alphabet, transition function, state start, and accept state. [^1] <!--SR:!2024-01-03,176,290-->

The FSM may be further classified into two types:
- deterministic finite automaton → [[2305221220]]
- nondeterministic finite automaton → [[2305221245]]
