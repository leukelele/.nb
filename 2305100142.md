**Supervised machine learning** [^1] describes machine learning algorithms [^2] that are trained on labeled data - that is, the learning algorithm receives {{a set of inputs along with the corresponding output.}} The resulting model [^3] predicts unseen cases based on what is known. <!--SR:!2024-04-26,229,290!2023-11-20,71,230-->
