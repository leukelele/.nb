pumping lemma.
If $A$ is a regular language then there is a *pumping length* $p$ where if $s$ is any string in $A$ with length at least $p$, then $s$ may be divided into three pieces $s=xyz$, satisfying the following conditions:
1. $\forall i \geq 0, xy^{i}z\in A$
2. $|y|>0$
3. $|xy|<p$

```
- $y^i$ means $i$ copies of $y$ concatenated together ($y^0$ would refer to $\epsilon$),
- $x$ or $z$ may be $\epsilon$, but the second condition indicates that $y\not = \epsilon$,
- the length of $x$ and $y$ together must be less than $p$. <!--SR:!2023-04-21,17,290!2023-04-25,21,290!2023-07-29,93,310-->
