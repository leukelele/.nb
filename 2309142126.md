How do you combine analog and digital note-taking methods?
```

- My initial thoughts would be to remove digital note-taking methods entirely, but obsidian is a very useful tool that I feel is a near necessity.
- Let’s pause for a moment and ask yourself what is the process to learning?
	- In reference to [[2302010228]], the development of a chunk generally follows these steps:
		1. collect preliminary information → analog note-taking
		2. simplify/generalize → transcribe necessary info to digital
		3. identify context → link to what you know
	- The issue with this method is that it feels as though it is possible to simplify the process. I could very well combine steps one and two in analog notes, which would making transcribing it into digital as unnecessary.
	- I say this, however, I realize that I am not good at selecting necessary information to retain. This method might actually be preferred for myself.
