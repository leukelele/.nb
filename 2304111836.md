In ArcoLinux and Manjaro, there is often a specific sddm config file that directs the system towards the sddm themes located in `/usr/share/sddm/themes/`; however, I have not identified where this file might be in EndeavourOS nor has anyone mentioned where it may potentially be in forums. 

Regardless, there is another option that likely holds precedence over all other sddm configuration files. The configuration file may be found as `/etc/sddm.conf`. In order to configure the sddm to include the installed theme [^1], configure the `sddm.conf` file to include the theme [^2].

[^1]: [[2304111925]] sddm themes may be installed from the AUR
[^2]: [[2304111920]] The r file contains the modification made to the `conf` file.
