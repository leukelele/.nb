As an example, there is a message that is separated into three packets, one router, and a single destination; the example may be represented by the following image. ![[2310010036e]] It will take $L/R$ for the first packet to be received by the router while also the time  when the second packet begins to be transmitted. Thus at time $2L/R$, the *destination* has received its first packet, and the router has just received its second packet. By $4L/R$, the destination will have received all remaining packets.
