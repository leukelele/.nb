In reference to [[202304112200]].

The objective of the project is to develop two functions, with 5 parameters [^1]:
- `project2-ai-1` which makes legal plays that get rid of the most amount of cards; if there are multiple ways that would achieve this play, then prioritize keeping the most kings - else, it may be arbitrary in its decision.
- `project2-ai-2` which makes legal plays that results in the lowest score hand; sometimes getting rid of more cards is ideal.

The functions should yield a list that is either empty or contains two elements [^2]. The requirement of project does not require that the list to be used and may be left as always empty.

A play may be either draw card, or a list of card plays [^3] that ultimately equal to the current count.

[^1]: [[202304112251]] specifies the parameters to be accepted by the functions.
[^2]: [[202304112257]] specifies what state of the list mean.
[^3]: [[202304112305]] specifies the list of card plays.
