Upon receiving an IP datagram [^2], the demux follows one of two behaviors depending on the format of the datagram:
??
- *connectionless demux*. [^1] the demux requires only the IP address [^3] and port number [^5] (2-tuple) to determine the appropriate socket to transport the segment towards [^4]
- *connection-oriented demux*. [^6] the demux requires the source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, and destination port number (4-tuple) to determine the appropriate socket

Regardless of internet transport protocol, the segment will typically uses the following format: ![[2311162337e]]
[^1]: [[2311062159]] “connectionless” references UDP as there is no handshake between the sender and receiver
[^2]: [[2310170117]] a network-layer packet is referred to as a datagram.
[^3]: [[2311142324]] an IP address is the unique identifier assigned to a host at the network-layer.
[^4]: [[2311062353]] a transport-layer packet is referred to as a segment.
[^5]: [[2310092050]] a port number is the assigned identifier to a process within the host system.
[^6]: [[2311062159]] “connection-oriented” is typical of TCP
