The host [^1] receives a datagram [^2] containing the source and destination IP addresses [^3]. Within the datagram, a segment [^4] holds the source and destination port numbers [^5].

Upon receiving an IP datagram, the demux uses the IP address and port number (forming a 2-tuple) to route the segment to the appropriate socket. This is the typical behavior in connectionless demultiplexing. In the case of TCP, a socket is identified using all four values (forming a 4-tuple): source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, and destination port number.





Regardless of internet transport protocol, the segment will typically uses the following format: ![[2311162337e]]

[^1]: [[2309142156]] the host/end-system is the endpoint of a network; the former is the producer and consumer of content on the internet
[^2]: [[2310170117]] a network-layer packet is referred to as a datagram.
[^3]: [[2311142324]] an IP address is the unique identifier assigned to a host at the network-layer.
[^4]: [[2311062353]] a transport-layer packet is referred to as a segment.
[^5]: [[2310092050]] a port number is the assigned identifier to a process within the host system.
