Generally, in C, a `for` loop follows the format of
??
```c
for (initialization; testExpression; updateStatement) {
...
}
```

HOWEVER, leaving out the `initialization` is possible so long as the updated variable has already been initialized prior to the `for` loop, which results in the following format
??
```c
for( ; testExpression; updateStatement) {
...
}
```

Additionally, it is also possible to simply leave out all user defined portions of the for loop format - that is,
```c
for (;;) {
...
}
```
What would this result in? 
??
The result would be an infinite loop. <!--SR:!2023-09-18,4,270-->
