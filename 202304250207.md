Given the collection described in [[202304250226]], the following model represents the collection as a linear combination of features: $$f_{w,b}(x)=wx+b$$where $w$ is the D-dimensional vector of the parameters, and $b$ is a real number. The notation $f_{w,b}$ is the model $f$ parameterized by $w$ and $b$. The model is known as a **linear regression** [^1]. <!--SR:!2024-04-08,215,290-->

Relative to the collection provided, the best fit - that is, the most optimal values for $w^*$ and $b^*$ - may be found in [[202304250253]].
