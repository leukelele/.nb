In order to identify the linear regression [^1] that best fits some arbitrary collection described by [[2304250226]], identify an arbitrary placement of the line produced by the linear regression and adjust the values of $w^*$ and $b^*$ according to the dataset provided by the collection.

There are two approaches:
- The manual approach, in which it is solved by hand, uses the method described here [[2304250312]]; or,
- The automated approach uses a common programming language, such as Python - described in the following node [[2304261851]].

[^1]: This node references the definition of the linear regression in [[2304250207]].
