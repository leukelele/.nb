The primary internet transport layer protocol:
- ***Transmission Control Protocol***. connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error checked delivery; requires a established connection before transmitting data
- ***User Datagram Protocol***. connectionless lightweight protocol that offers minimal services at the transport later; by sacrificing the reliability seen in TCP, data is transmitted efficiently and with little overhead.
