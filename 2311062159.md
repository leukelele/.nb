The primary internet transport layer protocol:
- ***Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)***. connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error checked delivery; requires a established connection before transmitting data
- ***User Datagram Protocol (UDP)***. connectionless lightweight protocol that offers minimal services at the transport later; by sacrificing the reliability present in TCP, data is transmitted efficiently and with little overhead.
