TCP requires 3-way handshake before establishing a connection between the sender and receiver.
1. The client wants to establish a connection with the server, so the former send segment with SYN (synchronize sequence number) and the selected sequence number.
2. The server responds by acknowledging the message; the first SYN bit is set to 1. The server selects its own sequence number, assigns to its *acknowledgement field* the value of the sender’s sequence number + 1. The server allocates the necessary resources for the connection. [^1] 
3. Upon receiving the acknowledgement, the client also allocates its own necessary resources for the connections and acknowledges the server’s acknowledgement. This is where the client may begin sending data in the segment payload. The SYN bit is set to 0 because the connection has been established.
