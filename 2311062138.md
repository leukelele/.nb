The ***transport layer*** provides *logical communication* [^2] between **processes from different hosts**, which differs from the network layer that offers logical communication between **hosts** [^1].

```ad-example
Consider two houses, with each home consisting a dozen kids. The kids of each house send/receive letters from the kids of the other house. For each house, one kid is responsible for:
- collecting the mail and giving them to the mail carrier for delivery
- distributing the received mail to the appropriate child of that house
```
In this example:
- *houses*. the host
- *kids*. processes running in the host
- *letters*. data created and transmitted along the network
- *responsible kids*. transport protocols
- *postal service*. the network layer

[^1]: [[2309142156]] hosts are typically end systems - that is, consumers and producers of the internet.
[^2]: logical communication. an abstraction of the underlying network components that creates the illusion that processes, on different hosts, are directly communicating with one another
