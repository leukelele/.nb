The **transport layer** manages the flow of data transmission through the host [^1]; its notable aspects are:
- *logical communication*. an abstraction of the underlying network components that creates the illusion that processes, on different hosts, are directly communicating with one another
- deals in segmenting data and reassembling received segments of data
- TCP and UDP
