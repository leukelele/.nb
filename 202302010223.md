The **Turing Test** is a thought experiment proposed by Alan Turing; though, it was initially called the *imitation game* by Turing himself. <!--SR:!2025-01-26,519,330-->

```ad-abstract
It is a simple test that determines whether a machine demonstrates intelligence. A human interrogator poses some set of questions that the machine is to answer; if the interrogator **is unable to identify that the subject is a machine**, then the machine exhibits intelligence.
```

The test is an attempt to sidestep the philosophical vagueness of whether a machine is able to think [^1]. The idea is not widely accepted to be valid as apparent from the Chinese Room [^2] thought experiment.
