VHDL’s `STD_LOGIC` signals are:
- ‘0'/‘1’ - both which are literals
- ‘z’ - indicates a float value
- ‘x’ - the value is invalid logic level 
	- This may occur if a variable was not initialized, or a component was initialized in an invalid state
- ‘u' - state nodes are initialized to this unknown state
