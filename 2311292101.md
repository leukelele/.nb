The ***sequence number***, present in a TCP connection, is a counter that keeps track of the bytes transmitted by the sender. 
```ad-example
If a TCP packet contains 1400 bytes of data, the sequence number will increase by 1400 after the packet is transmitted.
```

Similarly, the ***acknowledgement number*** is the a counter that keeps track of the bytes received by the receiver.
```ad-example
If 1000 bytes are received by a host, it increases the acknowledgement number by 1000 when it sends out a packet in response.
