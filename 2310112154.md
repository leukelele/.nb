There are multiple approaches to embedded systems development: [^1]
- *bare metal programming*. high control over the hardware, low power requirement, and minimal overhead; the systems are usually intended for simple, single purpose applications
- *real time operating system (RTOS)*. scheduler overhead â†’ more powerful microcontroller required, high control over the hardware, and multi-threading capabilities (as a result of scheduler); intended for multiple tasks
- *embedded general purpose operating system (GPOS)*. essentially a tiny computer
