# writeup
I honestly found [[2407040043]] to be more difficult that this level; after `ls -a`
```
$ ls -a
.  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  spaces in this filename
```

it becomes obvious that I can just `cat` and leave the hard work to the `tab` button as it will autocomplete after the first few letters of "space in this filename".

```
$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
{flag}
```
