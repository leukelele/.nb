The **flat contract** is a constraint that is applied to an input or output of a function or value. It is described as “flat” as to describe its application to a single value or function argument.  <!--SR:!2023-09-16,12,210-->

```racket
(define (square x)
  (contract (x (number?)))
  (* x x))
```
In this example, the flat contract `(x (number?))` specifies that the input `x` must be a number. If the input `x` is not a number, a contract violation error will be raised.
