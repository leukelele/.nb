In an institutional environment, the general network structures differs compared to the network within a residence [^1]; however, due to its size, it emphasizes certain network devices more clearly than in a residential setting:
- *hub*. connects multiple computers or devices together in a network; when the hub receives data from one port, it is shared across all ports
- *switch*. [^2] directs traffic towards only towards the specific device that requires it (within a LAN); this reduces network congestion (and is more efficient than a hub)
- *router*. connects multiple networks together and directs traffic towards the device that requires it [^3]

Notably, there is no modem that generally appear in residential networks. Institutional entities do not require a modem and

[^2]: The term “switch” and “ethernet switch ” are often used interchangeably; HOWEVER, it is dependent on context as a switch may refer to varying devices.
