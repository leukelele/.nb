This is just shallow research of the chinese-room and further investigation may be done so through the following sites:

> Searle imagines himself alone in a room following a computer program for responding to Chinese characters slipped under the door. Searle understands nothing of Chinese, and yet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals just as a computer does, he sends appropriate strings of Chinese characters back out under the door, and this leads those outside to mistakenly suppose there is a Chinese speaker in the room.

The Chinese-room is a well known philosophical argument towards the {Turing test [^1] and strong AI}. It makes the argument that a machine may be developed to appear to understand sophistication, yet in actuality there is no real understanding.
