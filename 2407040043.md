> The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

After logging in, I used `ls -a` to get an idea of what I was working with:
```
$ ls -a
-  .  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile
```

I didn't immediately see anything that caught my eye. I thought that maybe the password was stored in the bash files. Nothing, just scripts. And then I finally noticed the file/folder named `-`. Using the `-lp` options for `ls`:
```
$ ls -lp
-rw-r----- 1 bandit2 bandit1 33 Jun 20 04:07 -
```

From this, I know that:
- it is a file
- it is owned by "bandit2" and the group "bandit1"

Now the goal is to find the contents of what is inside "-". The issue now, however, is how can I get `cat` to work with the file name; typically, `-` would be used to indicate some option.

The solution is to provide context to `cat` that "-" is a file and not an option indicator. Using `./` should do the trick, as it represents the current working directory and provides the necessary context to `cat` that "-" is a file.
```
$ cat ./-
{flag}
```
