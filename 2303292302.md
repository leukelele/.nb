```ad-abstract
A language is regular if and only if some regular expression describes it.
```
- notice that the statement is the same as a biconditional statement $p \iff q$
	- *if a language is described by a regular expression, then it is regular*. The conversion of a regular expression to an NFA makes use of the concepts introduced in [[2303222319]].
	- *if a language is regular, then it is described by a regular expression*. In converting a DFA into an equivalent regular expression, it would require the use of a *generalized nondeterministic finite automaton (GNFA)* [^1]. The process is as follows: DFA -> GNFA -> RE.
 
The process of DFA to GNFA is very simple: it just requires the addition of a new start state with an $\epsilon$ arrow towards the original old start state and a new accept state with $\epsilon$ arrows coming in from the old accept states. <!--SR:!2023-05-20,38,270!2023-05-19,37,270-->
