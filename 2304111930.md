[GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) [^1] theming is fun. I have found a selection of themes that most tailor to my tastes - that is:
- [darkmatter](https://github.com/VandalByte/darkmatter-grub2-theme)
- [catppuccin](https://github.com/VandalByte/darkmatter-grub2-theme)

[^1]: Itâ€™s actually kinda funny when you think about, but GRUB was intended to replace its predecessor as the latter had become bloated. [systemd-boot](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/) is now an option as GRUB has become somewhat bloated in terms of its extensibility (I forgot where I read this).
