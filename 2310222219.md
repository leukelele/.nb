**DNS cache poisoning** exploits a bug in certain DNS implementations, taking advantage of the fact that recursive DNS servers will cache anything within the DNS reply.

A malicious or compromised authoritative server may return additional answers that can *poison the cache* of a DNS resolver. This may result in additional records: [^2]
- pertaining to a specific host
- pertaining to an authoritative server from a different domain

The goal is to redirect users to fraudulent or malicious servers or carry out other malicious activities.
