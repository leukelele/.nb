Using Rustâ€™s `Cargo` [^1] tool, a project may be instantiated with the following command
??
```bash
cargo new project_name
```
The command generates a directory of the name `project_name` along with subdirectories and subfiles:
- {{`Cargo.toml`}} [^2]
- {{`src/`,  which also contains `main.rs`}}
- {{initialization of a new git repository, assuming the directory is not already in a git repository}} <!--SR:!2023-09-19,4,170-->
