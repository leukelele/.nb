In the Domain Name System (DNS), distributed databases store **resource records**. These records contain information associated with a domain name and are used to answer queries from DNS resolvers.

The resource records are stored in **DNS zone files**, which are text files containing a collection of DNS resource records. They are typically hosted on authoritative DNS servers.
