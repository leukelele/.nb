# Types of social engineering
Social engineering is an extremely effective [^1] approach so long as the system involves a human in any way:
- **social media phishing**. collecting details through social media sites
- **watering hole attack**. attacking a website frequently visited by a specific group of people
- **USB baiting**. leaving stray infected USB drives in the hopes that someone will unknowingly infect a network
- **physical social engineering**. impersonating someone as to gain unauthorized access to a physical location

[^1]: The reason for social engineering's effectiveness is highlighted in [[2407040425]].
