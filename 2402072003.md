The ***stack*** is the hardware implementation of the “last in, first out” queue. It is an arbitrary area within the RAM; as a result, there are registers `esp`/`rsp` that hold the address pointing to the stack's base in memory.

When an item is pushed onto the stack, esp decrements by 4 (on 64-bit x86 systems, it decrements by 8) and stores the value at that location. Conversely, during a pop operation, the value at esp is retrieved, and then esp is incremented by 4 (or 8). [^1]
