In order to install and enabled the ly login manager, follow the instructions provided in the [repository](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly).  Additionally, should the command
```bash
systemctl enable ly.service
```
produce an error , place `--force` subsequent to the command as suggested in this [forum post](https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/how-to-try-other-display-managers-with-kde/34532).
