**union** of regular languages: $A_{1}\cup A_{2}$![[2303022058e]] In essence, the result of the union is the combination of two sub-NFA machines, $N_1$ and $N_2$, to form into one NFA $N$. The machine must accept the input if either $N_1$ or $N_2$ accept the input. Thus, the machine $N$ has a new start state with $\epsilon$ arrows. <!--SR:!2023-12-01,193,310-->
