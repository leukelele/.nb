**concatenation** of regular languages: $A_{1}\circ A_{2}$ ![[2303022115e]] The accept states of $N_1$ nondeterministically allow branching to $N_2$ The accept states of $N$ are $N_2$. Thus, the machine accepts when the input can be split into two parts; first gaining acceptance by $N_1$ then by $N_2$.  <!--SR:!2025-03-15,558,330-->
