> `project2-ai-1` which makes legal plays that get rid of the most amount of cards; if there are multiple ways that would achieve this play, then prioritize keeping the most kings - else, it may be arbitrary in its decision. [^1]

## pseudocode
```
1. order the hand such that it starts with the lowest value
(kings should be placed last in consideration for the project's constraint)
2. apply LSSK to the current hand
3. should there exist a subarr, play
4. otherwise draw a card
```

- n/a The algorithm somewhat reminds me of the maximum sub-array algorithm [^2], in that it involves the identification of a sub-array that produces the greatest sum out of  other potential sub-arrays; though, in this case, the task requires the sum to be equal to the current count. 
- n/a There is in fact another algorithm that more so mirrors the required task: Longest Sub-array with Sum K (LSSK) [^3].  The most efficient method requires the implementation of a hash table, which [exists in base racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/hashtables.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._hash%29%29).  For now I will spare myself of reiterating the logic and leave it its own file. The algorithm has an amortized time of O(n)

- 002157 I realized one large issue with the algorithm, it identifies sub-arrays - that is, data that is stored **contiguously** in memory. This is important because the cards arenâ€™t ordered. The solution that I came up with was to use a merge sort algorithm [^4], with an amortized time of O($n\log n$). This at least ensures the LSSK still produces its desired result; although, this is a lot more work.
- 003003 Additionally, I realized that there is also an important consideration that I had forgotten. The rule of pairs [^5], which the algorithm is not aware of.
- 003350 I think I will sleep on it for a bit and return with a more rested mind.
- 165849 I have completed the implementation of the algorithm in Racket.  <!--SR:!2024-05-07,238,290-->
