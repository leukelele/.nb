In arithmetic, operations, such as $+$ and $\times$, are used to build up expression; similarly, regular operations are used to build up a Regular Expression [^1] describing languages. Regular expressions and finite automation [^2] are equivalent - that is, any regular expression can be converted into a finite automaton that recognizes the language it describes, and vice versa.
