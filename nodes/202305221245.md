A **nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)** is a type of finite state machine that may offer several choices for the next state to transition towards as opposed to the singular *determined* option of a DFA [^1].  <!--SR:!2024-03-28,206,288-->

Nondeterminism is a generalization of determinism - that is, all deterministic FA are nondeterministic FA. [^2]

Similar to the DFA, the NFA is represented by a 5 tuple, in order:
- $Q$, is a finite set of *states*
- $\Sigma$ is the finite set of symbols called the *alphabet*, which defines the allowed input(s) that may be formed
- {{$\delta : Q \times \Sigma_{\epsilon} \rightarrow P(Q)$}} is the transition function (this is where it differs from the DFA)
- $q_{0}\in Q$ is the *start state*
- $F\subseteq Q$ is the *set of accept states* <!--SR:!2023-09-23,10,190-->
