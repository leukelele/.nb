The ***transport layer*** provides *logical communication* [^2] between {{**processes from different hosts**}} [^3], which differs from the network layer that offers logical communication between **hosts** [^1].

```ad-example
Consider two houses, with each home consisting a dozen kids. The kids of each house send/receive letters from the kids of the other house. For each house, one kid is responsible for:
- collecting the mail and giving them to the mail carrier for delivery
- distributing the received mail to the appropriate child of that house
```
This example highlights the difference between the transport layer and network layer in the following way:
??
- *houses*. the host
- *kids*. processes running in the host
- *letters*. data created and transmitted along the network
- *responsible kids*. transport protocols
- *postal service*. network layer

[^1]: [[2309142156]] hosts are typically end systems - that is, consumers and producers of the internet.
[^2]: logical communication. an abstraction of the underlying network components that creates the illusion that processes, on different hosts, are directly communicating with one another
[^3]: [[2310040126]] a process describes an “in-execution” program.
