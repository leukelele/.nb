The ***transport layer*** provides *logical communication* [^2] between **processes from different hosts** [^3], which differs from the network layer [^6] that offers logical communication between **hosts** [^1]. <!--SR:!2023-11-18,4,270-->

```ad-example
Consider two houses, with each home consisting a dozen kids. The kids of each house send/receive letters from the kids of the other house. For each house, one kid is responsible for:
- collecting the mail and giving them to the mail carrier for delivery
- distributing the received mail to the appropriate child of that house
```
This example highlights the difference between the transport layer and network layer in the following way:
??
- *houses*. the host
- *kids*. processes running in the host
- *letters*. data created and transmitted along the network [^5]
- *responsible kids*. transport protocols [^4]
- *postal service*. network layer <!--SR:!2023-11-18,4,270-->

[^1]: [[2309142156]] hosts are typically end systems - that is, consumers and producers of the internet.
[^2]: logical communication. an abstraction of the underlying network components that creates the illusion that processes, on different hosts, are directly communicating with one another
	[^3]: [[2310040126]] a process describes an “in-execution” program.
[^4]: [[2311062339]] [[2311062353]] the distribution and collection of letters is analogous to the demux and mux processes.
[^5]: At the transport layer, packets are referred to as “segments“.
[^6]: [[2310170117]]  the network layer facilitates the communication between hosts and is responsible for the routing of datagrams.
