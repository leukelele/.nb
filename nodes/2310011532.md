In following the *packet switching* [^1] approach towards a network, the amount of time that elapses between the *source* sending its first packet and the *destination* receiving all the relevant packets may be calculated by the following formula.
$$ d_\text{end-to-end} = N \frac{L}{R} $$ in which $L$ is the *bits per packet*, $R$ is the *bits per second (bps)*, and $N$ is the number of links. In addition, this assumes there is no delay in processing, queuing, and propagation. [^2]

[^1]: [[2310010036]] [[2309301759]] the transmitting data is separated into *packets*; the data being transmitted is allocated resources as necessary.
