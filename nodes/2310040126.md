A **process** is a program in execution:
- within the same host, processes communicate with one another through standards defined by the operating system (inter-process communication)
- in different hosts, processes communicate by exchanging messages through sockets [^1]

[^1]: [[2310040132]] The process communicates with a socket, which serves as an interface that abstracts away the underlying components involved in network communication lower than the application layer [^2].
[^2]: [[2310020159]] The application layer is the topmost layer within the model.
