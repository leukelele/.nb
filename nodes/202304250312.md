The manual approach, described in [[202304250253]], follows a series of steps as follows:
1. [[202304261755]] find the residual
2. [[202304261756]] square the residual
3. [[202304261804]] find the sum of all the squared residuals 

The best fit line produced by the *linear regression model* [^1], called the **least squares regression line**, may be found by identifying the minimum summation [^2].  <!--SR:!2023-07-14,2,228-->

![[2304270647e]]Assuming that the red line was the initial arbitrary placement of the regression line, notice how the adjusted values results in the blue line with a smaller sum of residuals; in order to find the best fit line, the sum of residuals must be at its lowest.

The mathematical expression that is being minimized/maximized is known as the **objective function**, or simply the **objective**, or the **cost function**. <!--SR:!2024-03-19,196,270!2023-07-14,3,268!2024-01-17,150,288-->

[^1]: The node [[202304250207]] describes the basic idea of the linear regression model.
[^2]: This may be done so by using the gradient and setting it to 0, which is further elaborated upon in [[202304261858]].
