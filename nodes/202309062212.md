## abstract
A **regularization term** $k_n(\theta)$ is an additional term added to the loss function [^1], within the empirical risk function [^2], and acts as penalty in order to prevent the ML model from overfitting to the training data.
## question
- [x] what is a regularization term?
## evidence
- a *regularization term* $k_n(\theta)$ is the additional penalty a machine learning model incurs for a particular choice of parameter vector $\theta$
- it is added to the cost function [^1] of the empirical risk function [^2] ![[2309062225e]]
- prevents overfitting
