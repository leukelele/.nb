```racket
; Define Cards
(define FACES '(A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K))
(define SUITS '(♠ ♥ ♦ ♣))
; A full deck of cards
(define CARDS (apply append (map (lambda (f) (map (lambda (s) (list 'card s f)) SUITS)) FACES)))
```
A majority of this block is self explanatory. The first three lines define the `FACES` and `SUITS`. It is the third function that is somewhat complicated [^1]; though, it ultimately defines a full deck of cards.

[^1]: [[202304112357]] explains how the function defines the full deck of cards.
