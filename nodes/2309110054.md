## question
What is a machine learning’s probability model? [^1]
## evidence
- the model’s training data is sampled from a real world probability distribution called *environment distribution*
- the model’s knowledge base is often built from the set of probability distributions; this is the ml’s probability model
## conclusion
A ML’s probability model refers to the knowledge base that was built from a set of probability distributions, or training data that was generated from the real world. [^1]

[^1]: [[2309102333]] this is the fundamental base for the statistical machine learning model.
