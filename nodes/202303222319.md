The concept of nondeterminism [^1] allows for proof that the union [^2], concatenation [^3], and star [^4] of regular languages are still regular. Regardless, this idea will remain as a blackbox and the results of the proofs exist in the following nodes:
- ![[202303291725]]
- ![[202303291728]]
- ![[202303291727]]

[^1]: [[202305221245]] desc. of NFA.
[^2]: [[202303291725]] desc. of union operation.
[^3]: [[202303292149]] desc. of concatenation operation.
[^4]: [[202303292150]]  desc. of star operation.
