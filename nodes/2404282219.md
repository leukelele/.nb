The **heap** is memory set aside for *dynamic allocation*; unlike the stack [^1], the heap does not enforce a specific pattern of allocation/deallocation. This allows for memory to be dynamically sized, though with the caveat that it must be manually cleaned up. 

Typically, a thread is allocated a stack while there is only one heap for the entire application.
