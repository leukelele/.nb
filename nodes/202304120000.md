In Racket, the `apply` function {{applies a provided procedure *proc* to each element in the provided list.}}  
```racket
> (apply + '(1 2 3))
6
```
<!--SR:!2023-09-19,70,250-->

Although, there are additional parameters the `apply` function accepts, which is the *flat contract* `v` [^1] and the *keyword argument* `kw-arg` [^2].
```racket
(apply proc v ... lst #:<kw> kw-arg ...) â†’ any

  proc : procedure?
  v : any/c
  lst : list?
  kw-arg : any/c
```
```racket
> (apply sort (list (list '(2) '(1)) <) #:key car)
'((1) (2))
```
