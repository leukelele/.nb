In assembly languages, there are two common syntaxes: AT&T (primarily used in UNIX/Linux systems) and Intel (used in Microsoft and other environments). The divergence in approaches is rooted in the development of conventions specific to each company. 

Typically, the differences between Intel and AT&T syntax are: 
??
- ***operand order***.
	- *AT&T*. Source operand is on the left while the destination operand is on the right.
	- *Intel*. Source operand is on the right while the destination operand is on the left.
- ***prefixes***.
	- *AT&T*. A `%` prefixes registers while a `$` prefixes immediate values.
	- *Intel*. There are no such prefixes.
- ***memory addressing***.
	- *AT&T*. Memory addresses are specified with the size before the operand with the use of parentheses.
	- *Intel*. Memory addresses use square brackets (`[]`), and the size of the data is specified after the operand.
