There are two approaches to switches in a network: [^1]
- *packet switching*. computer networks; transmitted data is broken in parts, called packets, in which resources are allocated as necessary [^2]
- *circuit switching*. telephone networks; resources are dedicated to the transmission of data from end to end [^3]

[^1]: [[2309272002]] switches relate to the intermediary occurrence within a network.
[^2]: [[2310011605]] while packet switching allows for resource sharing and is simpler to set up than circuit switching, this approach may lead to excessive congestion.
[^3]: this approach is commonly used by traditional telephone networks.
