The ly login manager [^1] was, evidently, designed for X.org, despite supposed “basic support for Wayland”. The installation and enabling of ly results in GTK [^2] warnings upon shutdown of the system; while this does not appear to result in any apparent issues with the OS’s functionality, aesthetically, it bothers me a lot. 

```ad-note
There does appear to be any mention of it as a [github issue](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly/issues?q=sway). When you have time, you should bring it up.

Notably, the code was write in C, so you could also try modifying the repository for yourself.
```

I have no idea where the root of the issues lies, due to my own inexperience with GTK, in addition to the short window of time during which I am able to view the errors that appear upon shutdown. Continually, this may simply be specific to my distribution [^3].

Regardless, the process for changing the system’s current login manager may be found in [[202304102337|this node]].
