Queuing delays [^1], in a packet switching network [^2], may be further described by the following levels: 
- $La/{R}$ ~ $0$ - queuing delays are short
- $La/{R} \leq 1$ - average levels of queuing delays
- $La/R >1$ - queue will increase without bound

where $L$ is the packet length in bits, $a$ is the average packet arrival rate, and $R$ is the link bandwidth in bps.

[^1]: [[2310011600]] the router is designed with a buffer to handle multiple packets; however, this can lead to delays, as observed in this node.
[^2]: [[2310010036]] a packet switching network divides its transmitted data into packets, which are then sent along the network; the reason queue delays are of note is because such networks are composed of routers, which may have queuing delays if there is heavy traffic.
