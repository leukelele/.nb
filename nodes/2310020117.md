In a packet-switched network [^2], queuing delays [^1] may be described in levels as follows:
- $La/{R}$ ~ $0$ - queuing delays are short
- $La/{R} \leq 1$ - average levels of queuing delays
- $La/R >1$ - queue will increase without bound

where $L$ is the packet length in bits, $a$ is the average packet arrival rate, and $R$ is the link bandwidth in bps.

[^1]: [[2310011600]] the router is designed with a buffer as a form of resource sharing; however, congestion is inevitable.
[^2]: [[2310010036]] a packet switching network divides its transmitted data into packets, which are then sent along the network; the reason queue delays are of note is because such networks are composed of routers, which may have queuing delays due to network congestion.
