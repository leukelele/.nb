If a language is recognized by an NFA [^1], it must be shown that there exists a DFA [^2] that also recognizes the language - it simulates the NFA. The following example indicates a method for constructing a DFA $D$ equivalent to the NFA $N$. 

Given the following $N$, ![[2302282257e]]
1. Identify the number of states present in the system; in this case, there are 3: $\{1, 2, 3\}$
2. Find the set of subsets in $N$ - that is, find the power set [^3] of $N$; in this case there would be 8 subsets: $\{\emptyset \}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}$.
3. Determine the start and accept states. In this case, the start state is $E(\{1\})$; additionally, states that are reachable from one through traversal along $\epsilon$ is 1 to 3 - that is, $E(\{1\}) = \{1,3\}$. The new accept states are all subsets that contain $n$ accept state(s): $\{\{1\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}$.
4. Construct $D$ from the identified subsets. *Recall* that $\epsilon$ [^4] is read after each input symbol is read.

5. The machine may be further simplified by removing all states with an in-degree of 0 as their removal would not affect the performance of the machine.
