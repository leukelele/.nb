Greek philosopher Aristotle, known for his syllogisms, was one of the first to attempt to codify rationality, or right thinking. Such laws of thought, called *logic*, govern the patterns of the machine. Regardless, the intelligent agent often falls to {{probability}} as an approach of allowing the agent to reason with uncertain information. <!--SR:!2024-02-29,184,290-->

What the machine will not be able to do is generate intelligent *behavior*. For that, it requires the theory of rational action [^1] as rational thought is not enough.
