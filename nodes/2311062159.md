The primary internet transport layer [^1] protocols are:
??
- ***Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)***. connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error checked delivery; requires an established connection before transmitting data
- ***User Datagram Protocol (UDP)***. connectionless lightweight protocol that offers minimal services in the transport layer; by sacrificing the reliability present in TCP, data is transmitted efficiently and with little overhead. <!--SR:!2023-11-18,4,270-->
