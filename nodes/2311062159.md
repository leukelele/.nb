The primary internet transport layer [^1] protocols are:
??
- ***Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)***. connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error checked delivery; requires an established connection before transmitting data. The sender will not overwhelm the receiver. [^4]
- ***User Datagram Protocol (UDP)***. connectionless [^3] lightweight protocol that offers minimal services in the transport layer; by sacrificing the reliability present in TCP, data is transmitted efficiently and with little overhead. The protocol has little regard for congestion. <!--SR:!2023-11-29,2,250-->

[^1]: [[2311062138]] the transport layer provides logical communication between participating processes from different hosts.
[^2]: [[2311062339]] [[2311062353]] at the end points of each transport-layer protocol, the processes by the demux and mux are involved by combining, separating, and directing segments.
[^3]: In networking, the term "connectionless" refers to a protocol without formal preliminaries - that is, in TCP, there are multiple handshakes required before transferring data while UDP has no delay in establishing a connection.
[^4]: TCP creates a reliable data transfer service on top of the Internet Protocol [^5], which is not the most reliable service.
[^5]: [[2311142324]] the network layer protocol that follows the “best effort model”.
