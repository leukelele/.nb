A ***demultiplexer***, or demux, separates the data it receives into segments [^1] and delivers each segment to the correct socket. The demux accurately segments packets by utilizing the attached transport header, which contains the *IP addresses* and *port numbers* associated with the appropriate socket.

When a host receives an IP datagram, the demux uses the IP address and port number to direct the segment to the appropriate socket. This is the typical behavior in a connectionless demultiplexing.

[^1]: [[2311062138]] transport-layer packet are referred to as segments.
