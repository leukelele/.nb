The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** operates in the application layer [^1], facilitating the retrieval of web pages, videos, and other multimedia content. It follows the client-server model [^2] based on TCP  [^3] and uses port 80 [^4].

Typically, an end system sends a request [^6] to a server, which then responds appropriately. [^5]

[^1]: [[2310020159]] the application layer is the topmost layer of the TCP/IP protocol model.
[^2]: [[2310032255]] [[2310032356]] the client-server model is an application architecture; a client communicates with a server.
[^3]: [[2310092026]] the transmission control protocol is a transport layer protocol of the TCP/IP model; it is responsible for ensuring that a connection between devices, across a network, is reliable and the data transmitted is ordered.
[^4]: [[2310092050]] port 80 is typically used for communication by HTTP; this is where the server’s IP address is located.
[^5]: [[2310092010]] specifically, there is more to it: client initiates connection → server confirms connection → client makes request → server responds with requested content → client indicates that content has been received
[^6]: [[2310040342]] the request made by a client is typically composed of a header and body, which provides the server context information in addition to the request for the desired document.
