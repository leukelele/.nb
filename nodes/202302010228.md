What are the two vital processes important to mastering and attaining contextual understanding? 
??
- bottom-up chunking process, which takes the form of practice and repetition
- top-down "big-picture" process, which allows for an overview of where the subject is placed in the grand scheme <!--SR:!2023-11-10,212,259-->

What are the steps to creating a chunk?
??
1. during focused mode, collect all preliminary information
2. understand the basic idea of the collected information
3. identify the context of the information gathered as to determine when the chunk is applicable in a given situation<!--SR:!2023-09-21,15,159-->

What are the steps to producing a well-developed chunk?
??
1. work through the problem
2. work through the problem again with an intent of understanding the key processes
3. take a break and study another aspect of the subject
4. sleep and possibly review the work done thus far
5. work the problem once more; shortening steps is allowed
6. do another problem and try to apply prior knowledge developed thus far, and amend the knowledge accordingly
7. actively recall the problem outside of the study environment
The steps discussed prior may be reduced to only key problems when pressed for time. <!--SR:!2023-07-28,17,130-->

How is a well-developed chunk useful? ::: Good chunks form neural patterns that resonate, not only within the subject, but with other subjects. The generalization helps to transfer ideas from one area to another. <!--SR:!2024-06-06,484,270-->
