A grammar consists of a collection of substitution rulesor productions. Each rule appears as a line in grammar; the former is comprised of a symbol and a string separated by an arrow. 
- The symbol is known as a variable, in which one will be designated as a start variable, and
- a string consists of variables and other symbols called terminals. <!--SR:!2023-12-12,202,310!2023-07-09,48,230!2023-05-26,6,250!2023-05-07,10,270!2023-06-03,12,270!2023-12-06,198,318-->
