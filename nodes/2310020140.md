**Throughput**, within the context of networks, describes the actual amount of data that is being transferred between the sender and receiver. [^1]
- *instantaneous*. rate at a given point in time
- *average*. rate over an extended period of time; usually over the course of data transmitted between the sender to receiver

[^1]: [[2310020148]] [[2310011605]] throughput is limited by its weakest link - bottleneck link, which is a factor in propagation delays.
