**Machine Learning** is a set of techniques and algorithms that enable computer systems to learn and make predictions or decisions {{without explicit instructions}}. It involves the creation and/or learning of models [^1] from experience and/or data [^2]. <!--SR:!2024-03-02,184,270!2023-09-12,6,192-->
