# creating a packet sniffer (ABANDONED)
## tasks
- understand the `pcap` crate
- [ ] capture network packets

- 114944 How does one go about creating a packet sniffer?
- 172117 ChatGPT seems to outline the necessary components well:
	- *packet capture*. a method for capturing network packets from the network interface
	- *packet parsing*. parsing for relevant information from the packets
	- *packet filtering*. filter the parsed packets based on some criteria
	- *packet analysis (optional)*
 - 173132 The first task is to determine how to capture network packets in Rust, which may be done so with the `pcap` crate.
- 181810 I have successfully create a short program that prints the name of devices that `pcap::Device` is aware of.

- 113730 Maybe I am overloading myself with too much; the task of creating a packet sniffer with little knowledge of networks is already a large undertaker, but I am also doing so while implementing it in Rust. I have no idea how to write a program in Rust.
	- What if you instead write the language in something like C, and then translate it into Rust. Lets take it slow, one obstacle at a time.
