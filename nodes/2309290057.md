**Address spoofing** refers to the act of falsifying the source address. In doing so it allows for:
- *DoS attacks*. [^1] as it allows for devices to mask their original point of origin.
- *Man-in-the-Middle attacks*. [^2]  an attacker can intercept and potentially modify data shared between two devices; this allows for eavesdropping or the injection of malware [^3].

[^1]: [[2309281829]] the device may be able to create a new mask once its current spoofed address has been blocked.
[^2] [[2309281854]] it is similar to traffic sniffing though with a greater potential for harm.
[^3] [[2309281811]] some such malware that may be injected are viruses or worms.
