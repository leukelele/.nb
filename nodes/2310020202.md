Due to the complexity and abundance of network protocols [^1], they are often described in layers as so to divide the complex functionalities of the system into manageable chunks [^2].

[^1]: [[2305222049]] which could be thought of as a standard of communication within the network.
[^2]: [[2309102338]] deductive reasoning is applied when analyzing protocols and communication patterns; the layers facilitate comprehension of protocol operation and potential inherent issues. Additionally, this logic may also be applicable to analyzing
