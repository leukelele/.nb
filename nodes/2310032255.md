The **application architecture** is a structural component in software application design. It dictates how the software communicates over a network and leverages network resources. It is typically designed following one of the two predominant architectures:
- client-server [^1]
- peer-to-peer (P2P) [^2]

[^1]: [[2310032356]] a client-server is as its name implies: a client that communicates with a server
 [^2]: [[2310040018]] the peer-to-peer architecture is decentralized by nature where participating, non-server end systems communicate directly with one another.
