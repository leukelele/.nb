When making changes to a file outside of the one opened in VIM. As suggested by an [SO](https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/445 "Short permalink to this answer"), instead of closing and reopening VIM, you can use the `:e` [^1] command (short for :edit). If you use `:edit!`, it will discard local changes and reload the file.

You can also have vim do this automatically with [`set autoread`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#%27autoread%27) in your vimrc.

[^1]: What exactly does the `edit` command do in VIM?
