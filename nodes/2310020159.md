The TCP/IP protocol [^1] stack [^4] is described in the order as follows (top to bottom):
- *application*. supports network applications [^2]
- *transport*. process to process data transfer [^3]
- *network*. routing of datagrams from source to destination
- *link*. data transfer between neighboring network elements
- *physical*. the hardware components

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the fundamental suite of protocols used for internet communication.

[^1]: [[2310020202]] the TCP/IP is one of such abstractions that describes the network in layers.
[^2]: [[2311052139]] the application layer is composed of the application’s architecture, world-wide web, DNS, email, and FTP protocols.
[^3]: [[2311062138]] the transport layer manages the flow traffic coming in and out of the host system
[^4]: [[2402072003]] while the use case of the “term” in this node is to describe the structure in which the information is presented; the “stack” is also a fundamental structure to end systems.
