The TCP/IP protocol [^1] stack appears in the order as follows:
- *application*. supports network applications [^2]
- *transport*. process to process data transfer
- *network*. routing of datagrams from source to destination
- *link*. data transfer between neighboring network elements
- *physical*. the hardware components

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the fundamental suite of protocols used for internet communication.

[^1]: [[2310020202]] the TCP/IP is one of such abstractions that describe the network in layers.
[^2]: [[2311052139]] the application layer is composed of the applicationâ€™s architecture, world-wide web, DNS, email, and FTP protocols.
