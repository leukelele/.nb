What does it mean for the machine to learn by example? That it is learning from labeled data? In which case, does that not mean that it is simply just a supervised learning machine?

This was likely no more than a misinterpretation. The intent was to indicate that the machine does not have immediate access to information that it may reference to but rather it must build its own knowledge that it gains from input data.
