There are multiple approaches to embedded systems development: [^1]
??
- *bare metal programming*. high control over the hardware, low power requirement, and minimal overhead; the systems are usually intended for simple, single purpose applications
- *real time operating system (RTOS)*. [^2] scheduler overhead â†’ more powerful microcontroller required, high control over the hardware, and multi-threading capabilities (as a result of scheduler); intended for multiple tasks
- *embedded general purpose operating system (GPOS)*. [^2] essentially a tiny computer <!--SR:!2024-01-04,1,210-->

[^1]: [[2309272035]] embedded systems act as crucial components in modems and other IoT devices.
[^2]: [[2310112302]] an operating system abstracts from the hardware and allows for users to approach the hardware at a higher level.
