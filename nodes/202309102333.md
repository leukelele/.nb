## question
What is a statistical machine learning algorithm?
## evidence
- an inductive inference machine (- machines that learn by example) [^1] as opposed to deductive inference machines [^3].
- built on framework of probabilistic inductive logic [^4]
- its goal is to learn from data and create a best-approximation of the real world

[^1]: what does it mean for the machine to learn by example? That it is learning from labeled data? In which case, does that not mean that it is simply just a supervised learning machine [^2]? [[202309110019]]

[^4]: what is probabilistic inductive logic? Maybe it is referring to induction by probability â†’ [[202303221754]] mentions how intelligent agents often fall to probability when processing with reason.
## conclusion
A **statistical machine learning algorithm** refers to a machine learning model built upon data with the intent of learning and approximating the real world. As a result, the model is probabilistic fundamentally. <!--SR:!2023-09-18,4,270-->
