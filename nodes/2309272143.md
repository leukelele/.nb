The physical mediums that create the physical pathways, by which allows for data to be transmitted across a network, are often one of the following types:
- *twisted pair* contains two insulated copper wires twisted together; it supports 10 Mbps up to 10 Gbps
- *coaxial cable* contains two copper wires that are concentric rather than parallel; they can be used as a guided shared medium
- *fiber optic cable* is composed of glass fibers that carry light pulses (each pulse represents a bit); it allows for extremely high speeds in addition to low error rates
