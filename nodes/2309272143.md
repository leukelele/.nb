The physical mediums that establish the pathways for data transmission across a network can be one of the following types:
??
- *Twisted pair*: This consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together. It supports speeds from 10 Mbps up to 10 Gbps.
- *Coaxial cable*: This contains two copper wires that are concentric rather than parallel. It can be used as a guided shared medium.
- *Fiber optic cable*: Composed of glass fibers that carry light pulses, with each pulse representing a bit. This medium allows for extremely high speeds as well as low error rates. <!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,190-->
