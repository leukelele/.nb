In a client’s HTTP request, there is typically a header and an optional body. The header specifies (and then some):
- *method*, such as GET, HEAD, POST [^1]
- *resource*, typically the target URL
- *protocol version*, indicating the current HTTP iteration.

The body is typically for additional data the client may send to the server; required for methods like POST or PUT.

The following is an example request header: ![[2310110138i.png]] the first line is known as the “request line”.

[^1]: [[2310041610]] the methods GET and HEAD retrieves information from the server while POST is used to submit information for processing by the server.
[^2]: [[2310041628]] subsequent to a client’s request of the server, the server typically replies with a similarly composed packet containing a header and optional body.
