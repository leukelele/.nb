Assume there exists some collection of pairs. [^1] In the following model, $$y_{i} = g(x_{i})$$the collection would be used to infer the function $g$. The identified $g$ may then be used to predict the values of $y$, given a new value $x$ - not previously present in the provided collection. Finding the function $g$ is known as **regression**; often, the decision for $g$ may be arbitrary.

[^1]: [[2304250226]] the collection of pairs may be described similarly to the ref. node.
