How does throughput differ from bandwidth?
```

Throughput, as explained in [[2310020140]], is the actual amount of data that is being transmitted from the sender to the receiver; while **bandwidth** describes the maximum transfer data rate - that is, it could be thought of as the theoretical maximum amount data may flow through its medium. 

Thus, I conclude that throughput describes actuality while bandwidth describes the theoretical.
