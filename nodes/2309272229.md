In an institutional environment, the general network structures differs compared to the network within a residence [^1]; it emphasizes certain network devices more clearly than in a residential setting:
- *hub*. connects multiple computers or devices together in a network; when the hub receives data from one port, it is shared across all ports
- *switch*. [^2] directs traffic towards only towards the specific device that requires it (within a LAN); this reduces network congestion (and is more efficient than a hub)
- *router*. connects multiple networks together and directs traffic towards the device that requires it [^3]

Notably there is no modem, Institutional entities do not require a modem depending on the type of network they use.

[^1]: [[2309272035]] in comparison, there are more devices that require the use of the network and thus require more components.
[^2]: The term “switch” and “ethernet switch ” are often used interchangeably; HOWEVER, it is dependent on context as a switch may refer to varying devices.
[^3]: [[2309272002]] connects the end-systems to the network core and thereby allows them to communication and transmit data across the network
