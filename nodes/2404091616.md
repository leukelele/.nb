Scaling the DPI with `wlr-randr` results in a very obvious difference in cursor size and theme. Instead, I found a better solution with `kanshi` which would likely be a better solution regardless as it provides profiles for multiple displays. [^1]

The cursor size, however, is still inconsistent across apps. While this doesn’t necessarily affect performance, it is most annoying cosmetic issue currently. Additionally, this appears to be an ongoing issue:

- [reddit mention 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/qtile/comments/ymbpsa/cursor_change_while_hovering_over_clickable/)
- [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cursor_themes) ← this looks to solve a majority of the issues
