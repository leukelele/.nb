Within residences, there are local network networks [^1] of interconnected devices, typically comprised of the following components:
- **modem** acts as a gateway into the network - it is connected by a cable, fiber optic, or telephone line that runs through the neighborhood [^2].
- **residential router** allows for multiple devices to connect to the internet as standalone modems are not able send data to multiple devices simultaneously; each device is provided its own internal IP address [^3] for routing traffic
- **access point** connects to the router to allow for wireless access by devices without ethernet capabilities
