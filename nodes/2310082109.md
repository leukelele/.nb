A **statistical learning machine** is an inductive inference machine [^1] with the goal of approximating real world scenarios; the approximation is built upon a collection of data that the machine learned from. The model is fundamentally probabilistic.

The framework that it is developed as follows:

[^1]: [[2309261828]] such a machine develops its own knowledge base rather than being already integrated with it.
