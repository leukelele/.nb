As stated by the `qtile` maintainer:
> DPI: this is controlled via the output manager protocol, and so you need a utility to use as a client, for example `kanshi`, `wlr-randr` or `wdisplays` (similar to`autorandr`, `xrandr` and `arandr` respectively).

My laptop monitor does not follow the typical resolution of `1920x1080` but rather has a resolution of `2880x1800`.  Using `wlr-randr` [^1], the command used for DPI-scaling (fractional scaling) is:
```
wlr-randr --output eDP1 --scale 1.25
```

[^1]: [[2402212256]] Recall that this was previously used with `riverwm` in order to turn off the laptop screen when closing the lid.
[^2]: It is similar to the command that I might have used with `xrandr`.
