Each line of assembly code generally follows the format:
```
Command(opcode) + arguments(operands)
```
??
- The opcode involves basic operations at the lowest level (move data, arithmetic, control devices, system calls, etc.)
- The operand consist of
	- immediate value(s) (e.g. constants)
	- register(s) (e.g. 8 general purpose registers for 32-bit architectures and 16 general purpose registers for 64-bit architectures)
	- memory (e.g. index, base, offset format)

The two most popular syntax for assembly code are: [^1]
- intel syntax (the easiest to read)
- at&t syntax (the most common due to its prevalence in Linux)
