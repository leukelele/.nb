1. Lets break it down. The following block 
	```racket
	(define CARDS (apply [black-box]))
	```
	defines the function `CARDS`. It is associated with some value as a result of the `apply` function [^1].

2. The procedure that is being applied to the `[black-box]` is the `append` function [^2].
	```racket
	(define CARDS (apply append [black-blox]))
	```

3. Subsequently, the list parameter for the `apply` functions must first go through
	```racket
	(define CARDS (apply append (map (lambda (f) [black-box] FACES))))
	```
	a `lambda` function that applied to each element in the list `FACES`. 

4. Finally, in the following code block
	```racket
	(define CARDS (apply append (map (lambda (f) (map (lambda (s) (list 'card s f)) SUITS)) FACES)))
	```
	 For each face value, there is a set of suits such that each individual suit is associated with the face value. `CARDS` is a list of nest lists. The nested lists contains `'card`, the suit, and the face of the card [^3].
