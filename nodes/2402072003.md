The ***stack*** is the hardware implementation of the {“last in, first out”} queue. It is an arbitrary area within the RAM; as a result, there are registers `esp`/`rsp` that hold the address pointing to the stack's base in memory.

When an item is `push`ed onto the stack, `esp` decrements by 4 (on 64-bit x86 systems, it decrements by 8) and stores the value at that location. Conversely, during a `pop` operation, the value at `esp` is retrieved, and then `esp` is incremented by 4 (or 8). [^1]

The stack is primarily used for:
??
- storing function arguments
- storing local variables
- storing processor states between function calls

[^1]: It's not deleted outright because it's computationally expensive to do so, and there's a possibility it will be replaced when that specific location is used later on. However, this could potentially be exploited if an external force gains access to the RAM's data.
