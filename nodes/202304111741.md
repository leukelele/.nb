Subsequent to the installation of the Minecraft Forge server [^1], open the `run` script [^2] with a text editor and modify the command to include the potential following JVM arguments subsequent to the `java` command
```bash
-Xms2500M    # this sets the minimum RAM usage the server should use - in 
			 # this case, the minimum is 2500 megabytes
-Xmx6G       # this sets the maximum RAM usage for the server - in this 
			 # case, the maximum is 6 gigabytes.
```

Additionally, you can include a 
```bash
nogui
```
argument as to prevents a GUI popup. The GUI contains a visual of the amount of ram the server is currently using.
