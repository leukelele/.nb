**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** extends HTTP [^1] by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server [^2]. This encryption is achieved using a protocol called **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** [^3], which succeeded the **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)**. HTTPS is preferred over HTTP.

An HTTP connection typically completes additional steps to establish a connection as opposed to HTTP.

[^1]: [[2310040237]] HTTP facilitates the retrieval of web pages and other content.
[^2]: [[2309301609]] that is, the additional steps involved in establishing an HTTPS connection allow for processes of *authentication* and the protection of the *confidentiality* and *integrity* of the transmitted data.
[^3]: [[2310141138]] the TLS/SSL protocol encrypts the communications between the client and server of involved in the HTTPS connection; in doing so, it prevents packet sniffing [^5]; the protocol makes use of certificates to establish trust between the client and the server.
[^4]: [[2311062159]] the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) is a protocol responsible for reliable, connection-oriented communication across a network; this is what HTTP/HTTPS is based on.
[^5]: [[2309281854]] is the malicious practice of intercepting transmitting data along a network and examining it for its contents.
