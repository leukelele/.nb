**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** extends HTTP [^1] by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server [^2]. This encryption is achieved using a protocol called **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, which succeeded the **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)**. HTTPS is preferred over HTTP.

An HTTP connection typically completes additional steps to establish a connection as opposed to HTTP.
