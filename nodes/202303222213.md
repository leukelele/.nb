$R$ is a regular expression if $R$
1. $a$ for some $a$ in the alphabet $\Sigma$
2. $\epsilon$ - the empty string
3. $\emptyset$ - the empty language
4. $(R_{1}\cup R_{2})$, where $R_{1}$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions
5. $(R_{1}\circ R_{2})$, where $R_{1}$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions
6. $(R_1^*)$, where $R_{1}$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions <!--SR:!2023-04-13,16,290-->

In items 4, 5, and 6, the expressions represent the language obtained by taking the union or concatenation of the languages $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, or the star of $R_1$, respectively. The $\epsilon$ expression represents the language containing a single string - the empty string - while $\emptyset$ refers to lack thereof. <!--SR:!2023-03-10,4,270-->
