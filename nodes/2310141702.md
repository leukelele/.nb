There are two approaches to DNS queries:
- *recursive queries*. the work of the DNS resolver is offloaded to the DNS server
- *iterative queries*. the DNS resolver contacts a server to request information from a DNS server. If the queried server has the information, it provides it; if not, the server refers the resolver to another server that might have the answer.

Once a named server learns of a mapping, it caches [^1] the mapping and retains the information until timeout after some time-to-live (TTL).
