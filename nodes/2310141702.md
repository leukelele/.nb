There are two approaches to DNS queries: [^1]
- *recursive queries*. the work of the DNS resolver is offloaded to the DNS server
- *iterative queries*. the DNS resolver contacts a server to request information from a DNS server. If the queried server has the information, it provides it; if not, the server refers the resolver to another server that might have the answer.

Once a named server learns of a mapping, it caches the mapping and retains the information until timeout after some time-to-live (TTL). [^2]

[^1]: [[2310170044]] a DNS query and is a DNS message - it facilitates the communication between the client and DNS server(s).
[^2]: [[2310222219]] however, there is an issue with this approach. A compromised Authoritative DNS Server may “poison” the DNS resolver with additional data with the goal of redirecting the user to malicious servers.
