There are two approaches to DNS queries: [^1]
??
- ***recursive queries***. DNS resolver tasks are delegated to the DNS server.
- ***iterative queries***. The DNS resolver directly contacts a server to request information. If the queried server has the information, it provides it; otherwise, it refers the resolver to another server that might have the answer.

Once a named server learns of a mapping, it caches the mapping and retains the information and will timeout - determined by time-to-live (TTL). [^2]

[^1]: [[2310170044]] a DNS query and is a DNS message - it facilitates the communication between the client and DNS server(s).
[^2]: [[2310222219]] however, there is an issue with this approach. A compromised Authoritative DNS Server may “poison” the DNS resolver with additional data with the goal of redirecting the user to malicious servers.
