The *client-server* architecture is composed of two components:
- an always-on **server** with a permanent IP address, and
- a **client**, often with a dynamic IP address, that intermittently communicates with the server

On the side of the client, a process [^1] initiates the communication with the server; while on the side of the server, there is a process that waits to be contacted.

The client and server do not have a direct connection with one another but rather rely on underlying infrastructures to facilitate this communication.

[^1]: [[2310040126]] a process is a program in execution; in the context of networks, it is part of the operations that allows for communication between the application layer with the transport layer [^2].
[^2]: [[2310020214]] parts of the layered model that abstract from the network protocols.
