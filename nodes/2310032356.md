The *client-server* architecture is composed of two components:
- an always-on **server** with a permanent IP address, and
- a **client**, often with a dynamic IP address, that intermittently communicates with the server

The client and server do not have a direct connection with one another but rather rely on underlying infrastructures to facilitate this communication.
