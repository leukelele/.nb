I am not entirely satisfied on `river`â€™s approach to behaviors relating to `lid` events and `timeout` due to inactivity. My current solution is to use the following commands that I found in this GitHub PR:
```
map-switch normal lid close spawn "wlr-randr --output eDP-1 --off"
map-switch normal lid open spawn "wlr-randr --output eDP-1 --on"
```

Another notable issue I have with the current state of river is the lack of an option to put the laptop into hibernation. I frequently encounter my laptop's fans running at full throttle after taking it out of my backpack. Although, I recognize this may just be specific to the distro flavor (and my own lack of knowledge). I have found some articles that may shed some light on the issue:
- [Power management/Suspend and hibernate](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate)
- [How to Hibernate or Sleep Linux From the Command Line](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-hibernate-or-sleep-linux-from-the-command-line/)
