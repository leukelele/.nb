```ad-question
In virt-manager, what is the difference between an i440fx and q35 chipsets?
```

This [reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/5ireij/differencesbenefits_between_i440fx_and_q35/?rdt=44145) seems to provide the major differences but the issue is that a majority of the text seems alien to me. I would like to revisit this to better understand what is being presented.
