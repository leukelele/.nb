Traditionally, HTTP [^1] is stateless - that is, the server retains no information of its clients; however, through the use of **cookies**, servers are able to emulate the process of *remembering* its clients.

Cookies are small information containers that the web server stores in the web client; this may appear as `Set-Cookie:[...]` in the header of the HTTP response [^2]. Cookies may be used for means of:
- authorization
- identification
- shopping carts
- website recommendations

[^1]: [[2310040237]] HTTP is relatively bare-bone as the protocol simply describes the process of a client communicating with a server; memory is not extensively involved.
[^2]: [[2310041628]] after storing the information in the client; the cookie will be present in preceding transactions between the client and the server so as to emulate the process of *remembering*.
