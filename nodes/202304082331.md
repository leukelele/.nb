Forge offers the tools that simplify the start point of creating a Minecraft server; thus, all that is needed is to install Minecraft Forge - specifically the version that corresponds with the desired Minecraft version - to create the base of the Minecraft server.

```ad-info
The download for Minecraft Forge may be found here https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/
```

After downloading the Minecraft Forge file, ensure that Java 17/18 is installed on your system. Assuming that the correct Java version is installed in the system, run the following command
```bash
java -jar [forge file]
```
which will produce a GUI that prompts for a directory that will be the home of the server.
