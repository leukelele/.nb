Typically, the HTTP response time is calculate by the following equation $$\text{HTTP response time}= 2\text{ RTT} + \text{file transmission time}$$

The reasoning may be found using the following graphic of the general procedures of HTTP. ![[2310102350e]]
- the *RTTs* [^1] are by identifying the times between “initiate connection → request message” and “request message → receive html file”.
- the *file transmission time* is determined by the time it takes for the server to transmit the requested document.

[^1]: [[2310110036]] RTT stands for Round-Trip Time, representing the duration between when a packet departs from the client and when it returns to the client.
