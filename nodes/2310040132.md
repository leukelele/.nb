The **socket** is a crucial component for communication between the application and transport layers of the TCP/IP model [^1]. The socket is the endpoint for communication between processes over a network and may be identified by the combination of an IP address and a port [^3] number.
![[2310040137e]] (in the image, the blue describes the flow of data through the layers between two machines; the socket connects the application layer with the transport layer)

The socket can be likened to a pathway that guides data from the transport layer to the application layer. To draw an analogy: consider a household with 4 children and 2 parents. The children send letters to the children of another household. Upon receiving the mail, the parents sort the letters to the respective child they are addressed to. The children are the processes and the sockets are the parents.

[^1]: [[2310020159]] the TCP/IP model abstracts from the overall complexity of networks; the application layer relates to how an endpoint [^2] receives access to the network while the transport layer describes how data is transmitted between endpoints.
[^2]: [[2309142156]] an endpoint means the same as an end system in that it is the ultimate final destination of data.
[^3]: [[2310092050]] a port is a component of the end system that allow the latter to receive data from the network.
