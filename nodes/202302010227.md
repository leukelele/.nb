The issue with the Standard Model [^1] is that it assumes the machine will be provided a fully specified objective to the machine. In real scenarios, detailed specifics are often not practical nor expected. Thus, constraints must be defined in an intelligent agent that align with common human principles, which defines the **value alignment problem**. Without such constraints, the machine may enact behaviors, that might be described as "unintelligent" or "insane," which are really a logical consequence of defining an objective without restrictions or specifications. <!--SR:!2023-09-28,16,150-->
