The government, at all levels, regulates all of real estate, in addition to common law; though they mainly oversee {{usage, taxation, and house administration}} [^1]. The regulatory functions include:
??
- public planners
- zoning administration
- building inspectors
- assessors
- administrators of federal statutes [^2]<!--SR:!2023-07-12,1,230-->

[^1]: My physical notes also mention that they regulate how real estate is developed, managed, and transferred.
