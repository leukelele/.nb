- Learning is paradoxical by nature:
	- Focused attention, is indispensable for problem solving, yet it also blocks the ability to problem solve.
	- Persistence is key, but it may put you in frustrating situations.
	- Memorization is a critic aspect of expertise, but it can also keep you focused on the trees rather than the forest.
	- Metaphors allow you to acquire new knowledge, but it may also keep you wedded to faulty conceptions.
	- Study in groups or alone
	- Start hard but then switch to easy
	- Learn concretely or abstract
	- Success or failure
