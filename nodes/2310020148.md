**Bottleneck link** refers to a situation where the overall data transmission capacity is limited by the link with the lowest available bandwidth.

This phenomenon can be likened to water pipes. Regardless of the size of the pipes, the amount of water that flows through the segments is restricted by the smallest pipe. In other words, if $T_{1} > T_2$, the flow through $T_1$ is limited regardless of the size of $T_2$. Similarly, if $T_{1} < T_2$, a similar issue arises. ![[2310020148e]]
