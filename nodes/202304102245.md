The login screen is known as a display manager, or **login manager**. It is the GUI that appears at the end of the booting process for the user to log in to the Linux system.  <!--SR:!2023-10-24,155,290-->

An approach to viewing what login manager the system has enabled, if it is not yet known, is to use the command
```bash
file /etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service
```

The result of the command may appear as 
```bash
# in this case the login manager is SDDM
/etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service: symbolic link to /usr/lib/systemd/system/sddm.service
```
