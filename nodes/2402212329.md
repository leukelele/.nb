To set up `KVM`/`QEMU` on my `Archcraft` installation, I followed [this guide](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-kvm-qemu-virt-manager-arch-manjar/). However, I found that I may not completely understand why certain commands were necessary in the article. It would be beneficial for me to revisit this later and try to gain a deeper understanding.
