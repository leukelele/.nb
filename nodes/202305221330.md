The introduction of the nondeterministic finite automaton [^1] yields the following concepts:
- if a language is recognized by an NFA, it has an equivalent DFA[^2] [^3].
- Nondeterminism allows a simpler approach to proving closure under regular operations [^4] [^5].

[^1]: [[202305221245]] desc. of NFA.
[^2]: [[202305221220]] desc. of DFA.
[^3]: [[202303222320]] provides an example of identifying an equivalent DFA from an NFA.
[^4]: [[202303292148]], [[202303292149]], [[202303292150]] desc. of union, concatenation, and star operations, respectively.
[^5]: [[202303222319]] provides a blackbox perspective of the results of the regular operations.
