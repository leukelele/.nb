Imagine a door with a mechanism - a controller - attached to it. The controller opens and closes the door. There exists pads placed at the front and rear of the door to detect the presence of an object. The door opens when it detects a presence on the front pad and remains open while the object remains on either pads. If there exists a presence on the rear pad first then the door will not open to prevent accidents from the door opening. ![[2302062320e]]

The states of the controller, as a result of the proceeding thought, would appear as the following figure if it were a graph or table: ![[2302062333e]]Notice that the door will remain closed if there is a presence on the rear pad and, subsequently, presence on both pads.
- ![[2302062342e]]

Evidently, the controller moves from state to state depending on the input that it receives. While in the `closed` state, if there exists a presence on rear pad, both, or neither; then the controller will remain in a closed state. A similar logic applies to the door in the open state.

The perception of a controller in the previous thought is an example of a {{finite automaton}} [^1], or *finite state machine*; this is a type of a **computation model**. <!--SR:!2023-08-24,94,290!2023-12-04,196,314-->
