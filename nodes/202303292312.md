Given the following NFA [^1], ![[2302272140e]] it is immediately apparent as to what the differences are between a NFA and DFA:
- there exist multiple exiting arrows from state $q_{1}$ - one that loops onto itself and another that enters state $q_{2}$
- NFA has an arrow labeled $\epsilon$ [^2]

Given some input string, as the machine moves along the NFA, it encounters multiple exits with the same value. In this case, the machine would create copies of itself and continue to traverse the paths in parallel (assuming the input string remains true in parallel). Nondeterminism may be viewed as a kind of parallel computation or as a tree of possibilities. Regardless of interpretation, the machine accepts if at least one of the computation branches end at the accept state.

Using the prior example of a NFA, when given the input string $010110$: ![[2302272209e]] Continual experimentation would indicate that the NFA accepts all strings that contain either $101$ or $11$.
