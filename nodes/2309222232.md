When encountering computationally difficult problems, the following approaches may help:
??
- understand the root of the issue; alter the root if itâ€™s necessary [^1]
- develop an approximate solution
- identify that the problem is difficult only at its worst case
- consider other types of computation

[^1]: [[2302061058]] it is good to understand that, structurally, computer problems involve the conversion of a set of inputs into an output.
