When encountering difficult computer problems, the following approaches may help:
??
- understand the root of the issue; alter the root if necessary [^1]
- develop an approximate solution
- identify that the problem is difficult only in the worst case
- consider other types of computation <!--SR:!2023-10-08,3,250-->

[^1]: it is good to understand that, structurally, computer problems involve the conversion of a set of inputs into an output.
