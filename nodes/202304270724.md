The reason for the prominence of linear regression [^1] [^2] in Machine Learning [^3] is because:
??
- among the potential variations of the regression models [^3] , linear regression is the simplest approach that also has the added bonus of rarely overfitting [^4] the data,
- it is extensible - that is, it may be modified to account for additional variables/features or include nonlinear features, and
- its ease of data interpretation due to its simplistic nature. <!--SR:!2023-09-18,69,270-->
