There are four notable factors that influence packet [^1] delay, of which may be represented by the following equation: $$d_\text{nodal} = d_\text{proc} + d_\text{queue} + d_\text{tran} + d_\text{prop}$$
- $d_\text{nodal}$ - the total packet delay 
- $d_\text{proc}$ - *nodal processing*. the time it takes for the node to examine the packetâ€™s header and direct the packet; typically less than a millisecond
- $d_\text{queue}$ - *queuing delay*. the time the packet waits at an output link for transmission [^2] [^4]
- $d_\text{tran}$ - *transmission delay*. the packet can only be transmitted once the entire packet has arrived to the router [^3]
- $d_\text{prop}$ - *propagation delay*. the time it takes to transmit a packet from the beginning of the link to router B; it may be as $$d/s$$ where $d$ is the length of the physical link and $s$ is the propagation speed

[^1]: [[2310010036]] a packet switching network has its own issues as highlighted in this node; there are multiple factors that affect the traversal of packets along the network.
[^2]: [[2310011600]] queuing delays may also result in packet loss.
[^3]: [[2310011532]] the transmission delay is represented by the following formula: $R/L$.
[^4]: [[2310020117]] queuing delays may vary in levels.
