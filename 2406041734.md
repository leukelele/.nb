The integrity [^1] of data is lost when unauthorized changes are made, whether by users or malicious software. *Hashing techniques* are used to ensure integrity.

**Hashing algorithms**, such as **SHA** [^2], produce alphanumeric strings that represent the current state of a file. When a change is made to the file, the string changes. A variation in the hash indicates a change but does not show what was changed.

[^1]: This node expands upon [[2406041346]] ensuring integrity through hashing, which is a component of the CIA security triad.
[^2]: I only vaguely understand what SHA is, it would be nice that I come back to this some time.
