Generally, what should be your plan for taking tests? Test-takers should first look at the hardest problems and be ready to move to another problem the instant development begins to slow. As the test-taker is solving another problem, their brain is no longer focused on the difficult problem, which allows for the brain to develop solutions in the background. At the end of a test, try to shift your own perspective and recheck your own answers. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,802,330-->
