A grammar [^1] describes a language by generating a string of a language in the following manner:
1. start symbol
2. rule that starts with a variable; the variable is replaced by the RHS of the rule
3. repeat step 2 until no variables remain <!--SR:!2023-04-15,3,232-->

The sequence of substitutions - or, replacement of variables - is referred to as a derivation. Additionally, the grammar may use the symbol `|`, which is congruent to "or". <!--SR:!2023-08-25,95,290-->
