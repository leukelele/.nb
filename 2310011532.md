In following the *packet switching* [^1] approach towards a network, the amount of time that elapses between the *source* sending its first packet and the *destination* receiving all the relevant packets may be calculated by the following formula.
$$
d_\text{end-to-end} = N \frac{L}{R}
$$ in which $L$ is the *bits per packet*, $R$ is the *bits per second (bps)*, and $N$ is the number of links. In addition, this assumes there is no delay in processing, queuing, and propagation. [^2]

As an example, there is a message that is separated into three packets, one router, and a single destination; the example may be represented by the following image. ![[2310010036e]] It will take $L/R$ for the first packet to be received by the router while also the time  when the second packet begins to be transmitted. Thus at time $2L/R$, the *destination* has received its first packet, and the router has just received its second packet. By $4L/R$, the destination will have received all remaining packets.
