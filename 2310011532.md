In following the *packet switching* [^1] approach towards a network, the amount of time that elapses between the *source* sending its first packet and the *relative destination* receiving all the relevant packets may be calculated by the following formula.
$$
d_\text{end-to-end} = N \frac{L}{R}
$$ in which $L$ is the *bits per packet*, $R$ is the *bits per second (bps)*, and $N$ is the number of links.

As an example, there is a message that is separated into three packets. It will take $L/R$ first the first packet to be received by the router, but

[^1]: [[2310010036]] the transmitting data is separated into *packets*; the data being transmitted is allocated resources as necessary.
