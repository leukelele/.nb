To my understanding, there are multiple authentication methods for SSH, but the main ones of interest are:
- *password*. the default SSH authentication method, where the user must provide a username and password.
- *public Key*. a method where SSH key pairs are generated, enforcing a key-based authentication

The internet-connected SSH server will be constantly targeted by bot-nets attempting to guess usernames and passwords.


Key-based authentication generally provides stronger security than traditional passwords because keys are harder to brute-force and less susceptible to common attacks like guessing or phishing. However, if you implement MFA, the password approach, while less secure, wouldn't be a completely terrible idea as it would require additional steps beyond just brute-forcing a password.

The main caveat with key-based authentication is that it ties access to the server to the client's private key. If the private key is lost, it falls on the admin to resolve the issue. Realistically, opting for key-based authentication shifts identification from being based on the memory of credentials to being based on the presence of a private key, which is typically tied to the hardware (sort of). Essentially, it is a trade-off from one potential vulnerability for another; although, generally key-based authentication will be more secure.

Regardless, it would be appropriate to switch from the password approach, unless you plan on also implementing MFA, in favor of the key-based approach. This is especially true if your SSH port is readily available to the public internet. [^1]
