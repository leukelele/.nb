The ***network layer*** provides logical communication between hosts [^1] - that is, it is responsible for facilitating communication and routing *datagram* [^2] between hosts, enabling end-to-end communication.

The network layer is analogous to the postal serviceâ€™s system in the following ways:
- *address*. IP address
- *port*.

[^2]: A datagram is used to refer to network-layer packets.
