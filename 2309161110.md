In my CS 4341, Omar Hamdy had previously presented the levels of abstractions present in a computer system that I had found to be rather interesting: ![[2309161115i.png]]

It is possible to view this as a checklist of what I should have learned from my degree (although, truthfully, I have not retained a majority of it):
- [x] problem
- [ ] algorithm
- [ ] programming language
- [ ] system software
- [ ] SW/HW interfaces
- [ ] microarchitecture
- [ ] logic gates
- [ ] devices
- [ ] electrons

When I listed all these levels of abstractions, I realize that I did not really retain anything from my degree aside from the problems that these computers are to solve (Artificial Intelligence).
