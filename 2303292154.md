Memorization is a necessity as experience enhances chunks and, as such, experiences need to be recalled; memorization may be done through phenomena such as:
- the generation effect [^1],
- the testing effect [^2],
- or simply just writing as it will increase the chances of memorizing the content.

What is the point of memorization? The memorization of concepts is what allows for the brain to retain the necessary information for processing; it creates a foothold of sorts for new concepts to attach themselves to. <!--SR:!2025-09-16,901,330-->
