The process to configure the ssh server for key-based authentication [^1] is straightforward and involves a few simple steps:
1. Generate an SSH key pair on your local computer, if you don't already have one:
```
$ ssh-keygen
...
```

2. Copy the SSH key to the server using the `ssh-copy-id` command to transfer your SSH public key to the server, this command is included with the ssh package:
```
$ ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
username@remote_host's password: []

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'username@remote_host'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

3. Modify the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the server to disable password authentication:
```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

4. Restart SSH Daemon in order to apply the changes:
```
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
