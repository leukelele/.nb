# configuring SSH-based authentication on a Debian server
There are various methods for authenticating on an SSH server, with password authentication being the default. However, this default method is not the most secure approach. In terms of both convenience and security, SSH key-based authentication is a better option in both regards.[^1]

```
I will need to create/reference a node that better explains how SSH keys work here.
```

## creating an SSH key-pair
First, an SSH key needs to be generated on the client device, if there isn't already a key, using `ssh-keygen`, which is included in the `openssh` package. By default, OpenSSH versions 9.5 and above will generate an ed25519 key pair.[^2]

```
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private [ALGORITHM] key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_[ALGORITHM]): []
```

At this prompt, you can specify a nonstandard path for placing the keys. Otherwise, pressing `ENTER` will save the keys in the default location: `/home/username/.ssh/id_[ALGORITHM]`.

In `~/.ssh`, the private key will be called `id_[ALGORITHM]` and the associated public key will be called `id_[ALGORITHM].pub`. Under no circumstances should the private key be shared.

Afterwards, the user will be prompted to input a secure passphrase ontop of the SSH keys. A passphrase is recommended but not required.

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): []
Enter same passphrase again: []
```

The passphrase adds an extra layer of security; however, the private key itself is never exposed to the network and is protected by file permissions, meaning it should only be accessible to the user (and root).

## copying the public key onto the server
The next step after generating a key pair is to copy the public key (the file with the `.pub` extension in `~/.ssh`) onto the server. Several methods exist for this, including manually copying the key onto the server. However, the `OpenSSH` package includes a utility called `ssh-copy-id` to simplify this process.

`ssh-copy-id` requires specifying the remote host, following syntax similar to `ssh`. For this method to work, password-based SSH access must be available.[^3]

```
$ ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
```

The following message may also appear, to which input `yes`:

```
The authenticity of host '[HOSTNAME/IP ADDR] ([IP ADDR])' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is [FINGERPRINT].
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? [yes]
```

The file `known_hosts` in `~/.ssh` will be updated to include the new host.

The utility looks for the saved public key `id_[ALGORITHM].pub` and prompts a password for the user's account on the SSH server.

```
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
username@remote_host's password: []
```

Upon successful authentication, the contents of the public key is copied into the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote host.

```
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'username@remote_host'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

## disabling password authentication
By default, password-based authentication remains active on the SSH server, leaving it exposed to brute-force attacks.[^3] To disable password authentication, the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file must be configured accordingly. This process will require root privileges.

Inside the files, there should be a directive `PasswordAuthentication`, it should be set to `no`.

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Once the changes have been saved, restart the SSH Daemon in order to apply the changes.

```
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

[^1]: In hindsight, the phrase "in terms of both convenience and security... better in both regards" is rather ambiguous. The initial setup for SSH key-based authentication requires some effort, but subsequent logins are quicker since they don't require entering a password each time, which is what I meant by being more convenient. The security aspect is indeed better, as justified in [[2407251026]].
[^2]: Prior versions default to creating a 3072-bit RSA key pair as may be found in the [OpenSSH release notes](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html).
