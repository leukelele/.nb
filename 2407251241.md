The process to configure the ssh server for key-based authentication is straightforward and involves a few simple steps:
1. Generate an SSH Key Pair: On your local computer, generate an SSH key pair if you don't already have one:
```
$ ssh-keygen
...

2. Copy the SSH Key to the Server: Use the ssh-copy-id command to transfer your SSH public key to the server. This command is included with the ssh package:

```
$ ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
username@remote_host's password: []

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'username@remote_host'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

3. Update SSH Configuration: Modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file on the server to disable password authentication. Change the line:

```
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

to:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

4. Restart SSH Daemon: Apply the changes by restarting the SSH service:

```
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
